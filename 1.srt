1
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,650
Jiwoo. Did you hear from your dad?

2
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,781
Yoon Jiwoo. You didn't hear from your dad?

3
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:58,118
You brat. You should answer
when an adult asks you something.

4
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,453
When are you done today?

5
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,831
Answer if your dad calls,

6
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,416
and call me if he does.

7
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,013
Hey! If your dad calls,
tell him to turn himself in!

8
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:20,598
Okay?

9
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,019
That rude brat doesn't answer after all.

10
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,861
YOON JIWOO, JUNKIE, IDIOT
GET LOST, DRUGGIE, PSYCHO BITCH

11
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,709
She's actually back.

12
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:52,088
I can't believe this.
What an honor roll student.

13
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,840
Hey, junkie. Why are you still here?

14
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,550
-Leave her alone.
-Transfer already, geez.

15
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,552
Don't. Her dad's going to come after you.

16
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,804
Bullshit. There are cops everywhere.

17
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,807
Your junkie dad
probably kicked the bucket somewhere.

18
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,858
I did well that time.

19
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,192
Whatever.

20
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,193
Hurry up.

21
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,236
Let's try again.

22
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,113
-Run for it!
-My bad!

23
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,449
Watch out!

24
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,742
My ball!

25
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,702
Dammit, she's fucking annoying.

26
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,456
What? What, fucker?

27
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,958
-What? You got a problem with me?
-Hey.

28
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,252
-She's so annoying, damn junkie.
-Let it go.

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,809
The school decided to transfer you.

30
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:49,270
I'll prepare the necessary forms, so--

31
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,939
Why am I being transferred?

32
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:55,109
Do you want to stay here and keep
making people uncomfortable?

33
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,572
Do you know how many calls
I get from disgruntled parents?

34
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:06,537
Have you still not heard from your dad?

35
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:12,502
HAPPY 17TH BIRTHDAY
YOON DONGHOON SENT YOU A CAKE

36
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,007
Hey. Give me that.

37
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,843
What? Get lost.

38
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,846
-Aw, are you sad?
-Are you sad?

39
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,099
Loser.

40
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,267
-So cute.
-What a loser.

41
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,769
-Hey, she's here.
-Give me my phone.

42
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,440
Hey. It's drugs.

43
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,025
Call the cops. I'm so scared.

44
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,821
How could you bring drugs to school?

45
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,328
What?

46
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,746
What, fucker?

47
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,165
-What's she doing?
-What the…

48
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,126
Did she lose her mind?

49
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,419
Shit.

50
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,920
Are you insane?

51
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,089
Are you fucking crazy?

52
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,966
You fucking…

53
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,516
You crazy bitch.

54
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,185
Hey, you bitch.

55
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:17,859
Hey, junkie!

56
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,365
Have you lost it?.

57
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,827
Hey.

58
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,171
What's gotten into her?

59
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:56,064
Are you insane?

60
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:02,820
A gangster's daughter
should do this much. Fuck.

61
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,330
Yoon Jiwoo!

62
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,502
SHIN YOUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
YOON JIWOO

63
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:18,795
I'll drop out.

64
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,719
SHIN YOUNG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

65
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,265
Kim Geonyeong, that punk…

66
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,977
-Oh my gosh.
-What the… That…

67
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,395
-Hey.
-Damn, seriously.

68
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,357
-You brat!
-Hey. What's your problem?

69
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
-Jiwoo. Hey! Stop right there!
-Damn it.

70
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,653
Hey, you brat!

71
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,072
Hey!

72
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,074
Jiwoo! Damn it…

73
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,371
You're dead if I catch you.

74
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,498
Why you little…

75
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:57,708
Where are you going?

76
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,045
Hey!

77
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,797
Jiwoo!

78
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,872
PHOTOS

79
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:04,025
Jiwoo, did you meet your dad?

80
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,444
-Yes?
-He's asking you a question.

81
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,988
-You brat. Hey!
-Come on.

82
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,323
-Are you a thug?
-Just let it slide.

83
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,859
The caller is unavailable.
Please leave a message…

84
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,606
Jiwoo, it's Dad.

85
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,569
Why haven't you been picking up?

86
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,781
Happy birthday, my dear daughter.

87
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,036
Sorry I couldn't
cook you a birthday meal. Gosh.

88
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,039
Did you get the gift I sent?

89
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,041
The iPad. Did you get it?

90
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,043
It's expensive.

91
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,088
Hello?

92
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,216
What did you do today?

93
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,469
I bet you went singing
with your friends again.

94
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,765
Jiwoo.

95
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,434
Hello?

96
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,604
Cops who are after you
have been following me for a month.

97
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,066
Rumors spread I'm a gangster's daughter,
so no one talks to me at school.

98
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,153
WANTED FUGITIVES

99
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:14,947
What…

100
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,035
What are you talking about?

101
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,119
You're…

102
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,706
You should have told me.

103
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:27,835
How could I? Your phone's off.
I don't know where you are or anything!

104
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,254
What is it this time?

105
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,423
Why do you do this to me?

106
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,509
It's not like that.

107
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,054
Jiwoo.

108
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:43,559
I'm going to settle everything
and go back soon.

109
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,189
So just wait a little longer.

110
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,569
I won't wait for you anymore.

111
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,699
I'll consider you dead,
so don't come back.

112
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,735
Sir. You can't use the phone.

113
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,413
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH
BECAUSE OF YOU?

114
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,040
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME?
AM I NOT YOUR DAUGHTER?

115
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:51,377
THE COPS ARE STILL OUTSIDE THE HOUSE
EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD KNOWS

116
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,212
DAD, WHERE ARE YOU? PLEASE CALL ME

117
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,553
-Taeju.
-Yes?

118
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,058
Get out.

119
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,861
Here. Here you go.

120
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,488
Gosh.

121
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,823
Cut back on your smoking.

122
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,284
I'm about to burst. Geez.

123
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,998
Shit. You asshole.

124
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,692
Jiwoo. It's Dad.

125
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,062
Dad?

126
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,920
Dad.

127
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,422
Dad. Are you okay?

128
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,716
-What is it?
-Please…

129
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,676
Not my daughter.

130
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,931
Dad!

131
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:58,772
Dad!

132
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,442
Open the door!

133
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,569
Don't come out!

134
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,612
Jiwoo, don't come out!

135
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,794
Dad, are you okay? Open the door.

136
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,422
Please, I want to come out.

137
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,301
Please let me out. Please.

138
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:29,887
Jiwoo.

139
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,764
Yes?

140
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,224
I'm sorry

141
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,478
I made your life so hard.

142
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,856
No! No, it's okay!

143
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,609
It's okay! Open the door.

144
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,486
Please, Dad.

145
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,364
How did it end up like this?

146
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,700
It's all my fault.

147
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,118
No.

148
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,496
No, it isn't, Dad.

149
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,914
It's not.

150
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,957
Jiwoo.

151
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,043
-Yes, Dad.
-My dear Jiwoo.

152
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,880
To me…

153
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:08,884
you were…

154
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,235
Hold on.

155
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,780
Hold on, Dad. No.

156
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,281
No!

157
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,331
Dad! No, Dad! Dad!

158
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,169
Dad…

159
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,133
No!

160
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,309
Dad.

161
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,895
Dad. Wake up.

162
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,981
Wake up, Dad! What's wrong?

163
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:09,486
Dad. Please, Dad.

164
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,031
Help us!

165
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,283
Somebody, please help my dad!

166
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,701
Please. Help my dad…

167
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,123
Are you the drug ring boss?

168
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,045
What did you make my dad do?

169
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,217
Did you make him…

170
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,140
beat people up, threaten them,
and stab them?

171
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,315
Who killed my dad?

172
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,778
Your father…

173
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:19,741
was my most trusted friend and brother.

174
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,246
And Donghoon was…

175
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,126
a good father.

176
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,257
Just remember that.

177
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,686
Come closer.

178
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,190
Please, come closer.

179
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,526
It'll be the last time you see him,

180
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,280
so say goodbye
and wish him a peaceful afterlife.

181
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,616
Hold his hand and send him off.

182
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,855
What a nice song.

183
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,024
What's it called?

184
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,609
Why is your hand so banged up?

185
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,488
Maybe because I get scared too easily.

186
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,493
Dad.

187
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,994
-Come on.
-Why not?

188
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,496
Stop filming.

189
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,539
Okay, Dad.

190
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,792
Yes?

191
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:56,255
If you could turn back time…

192
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,382
So, if you could…

193
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,175
-Turn back time?
-Yes.

194
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,761
If you could go back to when you were 17…

195
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,808
would you want to go back?

196
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,855
No.

197
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,651
Because then

198
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,070
I couldn't be your dad.

199
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,780
Whatever.

200
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,658
Jiwoo.

201
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:28,078
Should we build a house by the sea
and live there?

202
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,621
Let's live in Jeju.

203
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,123
No.

204
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,625
We can build a house on the beach,

205
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,336
hang a hammock in the yard,
and get a dog too.

206
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,546
Sounds great!

207
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,256
Let's do that.

208
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,342
When? When are we going?

209
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,260
Soon.

210
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,972
I'm almost done with my job.

211
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,354
This is nice.

212
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,012
-What is it now?
-What are you doing?

213
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,473
Why did you drop the case?

214
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,350
There's no murder weapon or a witness.

215
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,394
We have no leads.

216
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,896
So that's it?

217
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,319
What about this asshole?

218
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,237
You have to catch this son of a bitch!

219
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,490
Hey. How can we catch him with this?

220
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,200
You go and catch him then.

221
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,078
Fuck! A person has died!

222
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:53,663
It's okay.

223
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,626
What did you say to your dad?

224
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:00,170
You were the last to speak to him.

225
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,134
Yoon Donghoon was
on the national wanted list

226
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,470
and had been in hiding for three months.

227
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,306
What did you say
to make him run right over?

228
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,560
I won't wait for you anymore.

229
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,482
I'll consider you dead,
so don't come back.

230
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,028
You should have told him
to turn himself in.

231
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,114
Then he wouldn't have died like that.

232
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,283
-What the fuck is your problem?
-Hey!

233
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,660
-Keep it down.
-Come on!

234
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:33,829
You assholes!

235
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,580
-God damn assholes!
-Get off!

236
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,458
Let go of me! Fuck!

237
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,846
You might want to look at this.

238
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,523
SECURITY FOOTAGE INVESTIGATION

239
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,360
This is my dad's killer. Please find him.

240
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,949
You said he was
your most trusted friend and brother.

241
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,534
If I find him?

242
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,579
I'll kill him myself.

243
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,087
You'll kill him yourself…

244
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,932
Do you know what it is to kill someone?

245
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,282
Stab me.

246
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,163
Think of me as the killer and stab me.

247
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,751
Stab me.

248
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,629
Stab me.

249
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,507
Stab me!

250
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,113
Get her out of here.

251
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,313
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES

252
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,605
Want some drugs? Hey.

253
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,357
Let's hang out.

254

REWARD: 5 MILLION WON

255
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,690
Goodness. You always
buy so many cigarettes.

256
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,608
Thank you so much.

257
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,659
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES
REWARD: 5 MILLION WON

UNKNOWN NUMBER

259
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,269
I know this asshole.

260
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,562
Bring the money.

261
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,314
I'll text you the location.

262
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,361
Hey!

263
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,365
You're right on time.

264
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,574
Who is he?

265
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,410
I'll tell you if you show me the money.

266
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,120
You need to pay us first.

267
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:50,635
Tell me who he is.

268
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,519
That asshole's initials are G.R.

269
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:04,357
Grim Reaper.

270
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,694
He's the grim reaper here to kill you.

271
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,533
-It's really 5 million.
-Shit.

272
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:17,537
Hey. We kill people for even 1 million.

273
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:21,124
For 5 million, we'll even
preserve the body parts if you want.

274
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,376
So? Which parts do you want?

275
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:25,920
-We'll send them to you via parcel.
-Geez, damn.

276
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,922
You're not going anywhere!

277
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,136
Fucking kill him!

278
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,847
-Step aside.
-Fucking asshole.

279
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,689
Fuck, it's a girl.

280
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,817
Hey. She's fucking hot.

281
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,986
-Come here.
-Hey.

282
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:50,945
Hey.

283
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,656
Shit!

284
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,661
Kill her! Damn it!

285
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,250
-Bitch!
-Wait. Hey!

286
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,044
Don't kick her face.

287
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,296
Damn it!

288
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,200
Hey!

289
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,163
Don't you know how to drive?

290
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,331
-Hey.
-Shit.

291
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,041
Hey, pretend you're hurt.

292
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,710
That fucking bastard.

293
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,464
Hey.

294
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,175
You can't drive for shit.
Are you asking for a fight?

295
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,134
Fuck!

296
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,304
What the hell?

297
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,683
What are you doing, dumbass?

298
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,685
Shit!

299
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:19,742
Let go!

300
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:06,330
If you want to die, there are better ways.

301
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,921
It's none of your business.

302
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,057
Did you catch my dad's killer?

303
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,438
I guess not.

304
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,191
Stop acting out and stay low

305
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,651
unless you want to die on the streets.

306
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,531
How can I stay still?

307
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,912
The cops won't investigate,
and you won't do anything!

308
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,080
So how…

309
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,752
How can I live like nothing's happened…

310
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,220
when my dad died because of me?

311
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:15,441
Must you get revenge?

312
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,487
Regardless of the price?

313
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,663
That's for me to deal with.

314
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,091
If you're really determined
to find and kill him…

315
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,097
you must be someone
capable of killing others.

00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:47,283
Hello, sir.

319
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,540
Hello, sir.

320
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,336
Hello, sir.

321
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,923
She's a new recruit.

322
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,134
Introduce yourself.

323
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,274
What the hell is she?

324
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,111
Maybe she's a snack?

325
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,821
For us to feed on when we're bored?

326
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,990
Hey. She's just a kid.

327
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:31,202
Exactly. So we'll raise her well,
then eat her.

328
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,372
He said she's a member, not a snack.

329
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,750
Whatever, asshole.

330
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,128
-Gosh.
-He must like her. Crazy bastard.

331
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,380
Hey, kid.

332
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,966
Come with me.

333
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,235
What do you

334
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,821
plan to do with her?

335
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,075
She wants to get revenge.

336
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:16,997
Let her.

337
00:40:25,172 --> 00:40:26,924
You can sleep here.

338
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,476
From now on, cleaning, laundry,
and the dishes

339
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,853
are your duties.

340
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,897
I get to move up now.

341
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,567
I was the youngest until now.

342
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,819
For two whole years.

343
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,910
Once you prove yourself,
you can move there.

344
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,164
You become a real member
of the organization.

345
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:02,877
I'm going to make it to the top
when I get there.

346
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,761
Why did you come here?

347
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,847
A girl.

348
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,016
To get stronger.

349
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,190
Sure.

350
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,193
I bid you luck.

351
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:48,255
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

352
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,177
Don't worry.

353
00:41:58,557 --> 00:41:59,767
I can handle it.

354
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,969
Hey, newbie!

355
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,138
Hey!

356
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,018
Oh, you're sexy

357
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,853
Sexy, sexy, sexy!

358
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:45,896
All together!

359
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,856
Sexy, sexy, sexy!

360
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,610
Sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy!

361
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,406
What are you glaring at, fucking bitch?

362
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,492
Give me a piece of that ass.

363
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,161
Me too!

364
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,247
Hey. You're the prettiest one here.

365
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,792
You're absolutely the fucking prettiest!

366
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,461
-A man is declaring his love and--
-Damn it!

367
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,169
She's so fucking annoying.

368
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,089
Are you okay?

369
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,215
Damn it!

370
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,134
How petite.

371
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,889
Look at the fire in her eyes.

372
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,391
Do you want to fight?

373
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,684
Fuck!

374
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,812
You fucking bitch.

375
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,022
Geez.

376
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,524
Give me some ass.

377
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:15,819
Fucking bitch.

378
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,655
Hey. Stop it.

379
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:21,033
Why are you here if you're not
going to fuck us, you cunt?

380
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,994
That fucking bitch started it!
Let go of me!

381
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:24,953
Get off!

382
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,752
Are you thinking of running away?

383
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,422
I'm thinking of winning.

384
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,343
Exactly.

385
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,013
You can't win like that.

386
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,645
It's not "winning"

387
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,898
but "killing."

388
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,193
Kill him.

389
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,990
That's what you should think.

390
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,201
Don't try to use your strength.

391
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,745
No matter how much you train,
they'll be stronger.

392
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,038
Then what do I do?

393
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,130
Attack their vital points.

394
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:06,513
The temple, upper lip, chin, solar plexus,

395
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,308
and genitals.

396
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,439
Just their vital points.

397
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,318
Then you can incapacitate your opponent.

398
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,034
Let's try it.

399
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,495
What?

400
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,121
Come here.

401
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:09,493
Upper lip.

402
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,749
Harder!

403
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,251
Chin.

404
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,670
Keep your guard up.

405
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,480
Are you okay?

406
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:40,983
That one was good.

407
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,611
You've got talent, but not enough power.

408
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,196
Again.

409
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,788
DO NOT ENTER

410
00:49:17,871 --> 00:49:19,873
-We protect the organization!
-We protect the organization!

411
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,627
The organization protects us.

412
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,004
-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!

413
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:06,545
Hold on.

414
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:55,260
Do Gangjae wins!

415
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,973
Your reward is a week's vacation
and a cash prize of 10 million won.

416
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,232
-Do Gangjae!
-Do Gangjae!

417
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,276
I think the rookie's still left.

418
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:44,578
