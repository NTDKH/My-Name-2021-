1
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,533
Crush her!

2
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:36,995
Let's go!

3
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:09,295
-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!

4
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,007
-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!

5
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,970
You up, moron?

6
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,180
Now that you're up,

7
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,974
go and kill yourself.

8
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:28,106
You got beat up
by a fucking girl and passed out.

9
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,024
I'd die from the humiliation…

10
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,393
About earlier…

11
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:11,316
I'm sorry.

12
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,612
What are you sorry for?

13
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,156
It was a competition.

14
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,666
Hey, how about a midnight snack?

15
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,377
What? Are you craving soju?

16
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:33,171
So you can drink yourself to death?

17
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,088
No.

18
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,341
That's not what I mean.

19
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,071
What?

20
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,908
Are you scared?
You said you wanted to all this time.

21
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,702
Has this asshole lost his mind?

22
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,372
Hey.

23
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:08,623
Don't be stupid.

24
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,750
The boss brought her here.

25
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,710
She won't remember a thing.

26
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,214
I roofied her water.

27
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,809
What a scheming asshole you are.

28
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,770
How can I refuse
when you went through all the trouble?

29
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,524
Hey.

30
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,861
Don't go if you're scared, sissy.

31
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,592
Thanks, Gangjae.

32
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:48,765
I told you you're the prettiest one here,
fucking bitch.

33
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,392
I'm so hard right now. She looks yummy.

34
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:59,275
I won't be too rough. Stay still.

35
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,782
Stay still.

36
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,950
It'll be over soon.

37
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,622
Come on.

38
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,916
Fuck, she's driving me mad.

39
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,086
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

40
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,464
Fuck!

41
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,221
I'll kill you both.

42
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:33,184
-I'll kill you both.
-Damn, this fucking bitch.

43
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:35,853
Shit!

44
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,482
You fucking bitch!

45
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,619
You need to die.

46
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,079
I'm fucking screwed!

47
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,163
Come here, bitch.

48
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,543
-Gangjae! I'm so screwed.
-Damn it!

49
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,838
I'm screwed, you fucking asshole!

50
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:02,922
Come here.

51
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,925
Where the fuck are you going?

52
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,974
-Gangjae! Stop it!
-Fucking bitch.

53
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,058
Gangjae!

54
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,494
Face, arm, leg.

55
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,247
Choose one.

56
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,041
I'll only mangle one.

57
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,056
I'm sorry.

58
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,809
It was a mistake.

59
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,728
That's why…

60
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,648
I won't kill you.

61
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,566
Choose.

62
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,321
Are you abandoning me?

63
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,242
You said I was useful.

64
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,578
It's quite unfortunate.

65
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,628
I figured this was inevitable.

66
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,088
It was something she had to
go through at least once.

67
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,799
But I didn't know…

68
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,556
it would be you.

69
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,767
Please, forgive me.

70
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,395
All I did was beat some bitch up a little!

71
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,776
I brought her personally.

72
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,738
You shouldn't have touched her.

73
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,208
Which will it be?

74
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,004
I'll decide.

75
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,174
Please. No. Please no.

76
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,467
Please, don't.

77
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:54,510
DECEASED, YOON DONGHOON

78
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,946
If you're done crying, leave.

79
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,491
Because of you,

80
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,160
I lost a valued subordinate.

81
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,623
This is your last chance.

82
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,961
Your chance to stop being foolish.

83
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,424
I'm not going anywhere.

84
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,012
I served Donghoon

85
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,806
very closely.

86
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,685
He didn't belong in a crime ring.

87
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,146
The same goes for you.

88
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,607
Stop it now.

89
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,281
It's too late to stop.

90
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,061
Sit.

91
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:05,159
I used to come here often with Donghoon.

92
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,581
Did your dad teach you how to drink?

93
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:23,260
Drink.

94
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,902
Does it hurt?

95
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,406
No.

96
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,411
You never learned
how to say that you're in pain.

97
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,873
Or you had no one to teach you.

98
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,587
There was one person…

99
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,633
but he died.

100
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,681
Perhaps, living…

101
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,601
is the process
of meeting someone like that.

102
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,647
Someone you can tell that you're in pain

103
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,983
and that things are too hard.

104
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:23,612
Do you have someone like that?

105
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,074
I did, but he died.

106
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:55,728
Yoon Jiwoo died today.

107
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,567
Do Gangjae was expelled.

108
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,360
Gangjae

109
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,571
killed the girl.

110
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,116
Oh Hyejin.

111
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,578
From now on,

112
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,081
you'll live by this name.

113
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,013
This is the gun that killed your dad.

114
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,391
The killer dumped it, and we found it.

115
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,646
Who was it?

116
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,190
This gun is a police issue.

117
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,027
Dong-hun's killer is a cop.

118
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,864
Find him

119
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,533
and kill him.

120
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,975
From now on,
your life belongs to the organization.

121
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,689
No matter what you do,
the organization will protect you.

122
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,443
Betray us, and we will kill you.

123
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,192
What now?

124
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,528
We go up.

125
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:53,697
What?

126
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,075
We don't know how many there are.

127
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,938
Hey. Call for backup
and come to the entrance.

128
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,914
This is--

129
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,232
Who are you?

130
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,733
Excuse me?

131
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:14,361
What?

132
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,572
Which department are you with, asshole?

133
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,199
Money first.

134
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,497
That's way too expensive
to hand over to you.

135
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,957
Call your boss.

136
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,918
Shit.

137
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,337
If we're going to be partners,
I should see him at least.

138
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,172
We need to share the risk.

139
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,133
Gosh.

140
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,470
Meth supply is running low these days,

141
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,306
but I guess not you guys.

142
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:07,933
Forget it.

143
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,768
-I'm leaving.
-All right.

144
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,728
Sit.

145
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,647
Shall I?

146
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,483
Radio her that this is a sting.

147
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,695
You little…

148
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:21,863
Now.

149
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,909
This twerp came alone
and he wants to talk in person.

150
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,828
Hyejin.

151
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,997
-I can't believe this.
-They're in the middle of an operation.

152
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,290
Hyejin.

153
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,374
Hyejin.

154
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,254
-Freeze. Police.
-Are you a narc?

155
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,880
-What the hell are you saying?
-Changoo, get up.

156
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,424
Damn it!

157
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,222
-Shit.
-Let's go!

158
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,183
He's getting away! Grab that asshole!

159
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,211
Hey. Block all exits. Get them.

160
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,302
Park Changoo. You're under arrest
for the murder of Lee Sumin.

161
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,014
Damn it! I'll walk on my own.

162
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,682
-Hey.
-Shit.

163
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,641
Stop right there.

164
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,310
-Hey!
-Seriously!

165
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,062
-I said I can walk on my own.
-Damn it.

166
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:35,979
Hey!

167
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,526
Who are you, jerk?

168
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,986
What about you, jerk?

169
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,945
What?

170
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,576
Sergeant Jeon Pildo from Narcotics.

171
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,994
So you are a narc!

172
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,123
Violent Crimes Team Two,
Corporal Oh Hyejin.

173
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,126
Hey, are you okay? Try to get up.

174
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,463
My leg. I think it's broken.

175
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,714
Get a grip.

176
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:03,924
Gosh.

177
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,133
-Get an ambulance.
-Yes, sir.

178
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,510
Clean this up.

179
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,887
Hey. Where's Pildo?

180
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,846
He's upstairs.

181
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,184
Do you know what you've done?

182
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,227
Pretty much.

183
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,980
-I think I do, sir.
-That's not enough.

184
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,359
You just shat on
a six-month-long operation.

185
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,403
We're taking this asshole.

186
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,863
Damn it!

187
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,116
-You can't do that.
-I can't…

188
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,242
I can't?

189
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,578
Can't you make heads or tails of this?

190
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,872
Are you messing with me?

191
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,874
-He's a murder suspect.
-Hyejin!

192
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,586
It's Captain Lee.

193
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,882
-Get over here.
-Gosh, seriously.

194
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,261
Yes, sir.

195
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,222
What?

196
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,600
All right, sir.

197
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,064
Send him over once you're done with him.

198
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,151
Stop right there.

199
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,360
Hey!

200
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:09,030
I never want to see you again.

201
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,908
-Get over here.
-Hold on.

202
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,703
I'll walk on my own!

203
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,248
Move it.

204
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,375
Damn it.

205
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,703
Mr. Choi.

206
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,372
I'm sorry.

207
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,375
This will never happen again.

208
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,795
We've worked together for ten years.
Haven't we?

209
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,471
Exactly.

210
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,434
Ten years. So why did you do it?

211
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:23,438
You know very well what I'm like.

212
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,150
I'll give you the factory and the drugs.

213
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,279
I must have lost my mind for a minute.

214
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,658
Please spare me.

215
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,203
My daughter just started college.

216
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,165
I'll make sure
your family has a nice funeral.

217
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,167
Mr. Choi.

218
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,795
Mr. Choi.

219
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:48,755
Mr. Choi…

220
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,014
What are you doing? Let go.

221
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,101
That asshole.

222
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,617
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

223
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,877
Did you get them checked?

224
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,635
Corporal Oh Hyejin?

225
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,145
Yes, I'm Oh Hyejin.

226
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,985
Do you know who I am?

227
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,823
I do, sir.

228
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,993
Captain Cha Giho of Narcotics.

229
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,921
OFFICER: OPEN RECRUIT
CORPORAL: SPECIAL PROMOTION

230
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,508
FATHER: OH JINYEONG
MOTHER: BAE SUYEON

231
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,385
Why did you do it?

232
00:27:59,135 --> 00:27:59,969
Pardon?

233
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,847
You didn't have conclusive evidence.

234
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,892
The arrest was unreasonable.

235
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:09,687
The motive was clear
and there was a high risk of him fleeing.

236
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,356
That's insufficient
for an arrest without a warrant.

237
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,899
Park Changoo has three priors.

238
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,443
He'd flee for sure if I said I was a cop.

239
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,821
It was sufficient.

240
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,622
You applied to our team twice.

241
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,291
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

242
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,460
Why do you want to join our team?

243
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:36,965
There's someone I want to catch.

244
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,049
Who?

245
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,722
Is there something you can't tell me?

246
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,227
I like punks like that.

247
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:53,732
You can't survive in Narcotics
if you're here for its salary or pension.

248
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:42,030
Did I keep you waiting?

249
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,823
Yes.

250
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,701
Have this.

251
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,000
What is it?

252
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,629
Chamomile tea. It's good for insomnia.

253
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,381
I know you don't get much sleep.

254
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:08,807
Why does it taste like makeup?

255
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,144
I won't fall asleep. It's gross.

256
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:18,149
How do you like being a cop?

257
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,073
I'm being transferred to Narcotics.

258
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,786
Now, it's starting for real.

259
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:36,084
I can finally find the owner of the gun

260
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,047
and what Cha Giho has to do with this.

261
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,258
And

262
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,802
I'll find out…

263
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,806
who killed my dad.

264
00:30:56,646 --> 00:31:00,149
My dad and I promised we'd build a house
on a beach and live there.

265
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,697
We'd hang a hammock out front,
fish and swim every day

266
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,532
like people with nothing to do.

267
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,453
He wanted to live like that…

268
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,964
If he hadn't killed Dad…

269
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,178
would I have been able to live like that?

270
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,938
See that warehouse?

271
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,025
About ten years ago,

272
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,818
Donghoon saved my life there.

273
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:48,990
Everyone was attacking us,
trying to swallow up our organization.

274
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,712
Mujin!

275
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,978
Hey.

276
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,104
You lunatic.

277
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,607
How did you find me?

278
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,735
Shit.

279
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:26,778
Hey.

280
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,489
How can I leave you behind?

281
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,282
-Get up.
-It hurts.

282
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,867
-Get up.
-It hurts.

283
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,002
Smile for the camera.

284
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,673
-Will you be okay?
-We've gotten old.

285
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,262
This is my knife.

286
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,812
Kill him as soon as you find him.

287
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,065
Trust me.

288
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,319
No matter what happens,
the organization will protect you.

289
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,019
See you later.

290
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,900
Gosh, these police investigations…

291
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,737
Hey, asshole! Answer my question!

292
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,282
-Why are you swearing? You'll scare him.
-Is he allowed to do that?

293
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,700
He's all shaken up now.

294
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,201
Gosh.

295
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,202
Changoo.

296
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:02,123
Who cares about loyalty anymore?
Money is your boss, isn't it?

297
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:03,750
Here.

298
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,879
Give us five dealers and your boss.

299
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,468
Your dad's turning 60 soon.
The youngest can't miss his celebration.

300
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,428
-Write them down.
-But…

301
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:18,514
Fucking forget it. There are
plenty of other assholes who'll talk.

302
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,808
-Get up. You little…
-Wait! Hold on!

303
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,019
Sir.

304
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,607
I can't give up our boss.

305
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,025
Asshole.

306
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,943
You keep playing hard to get.

307
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:35,531
Are you trying to date me?

308
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,789
Something else.

309
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,417
I'll give you something else.

310
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,294
What?

311
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,005
Are you mad?

312
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,674
The candy in circulation lately…

313
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,609
Do you know where it's from?

314
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,365
CALL US ANYTIME IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS

315
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,034
-You asshole. Are you trying to mess--
-Wait.

316
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:23,955
Who is it?

317
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,416
Mango.

318
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,879
I'll be right back.

319
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,090
INTERROGATION ROOM

320
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,091
Hey.

321
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,552
Do you keep in touch with Mango?

322
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,013
Right.

323
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,142
Find out where Mango is.
Hold on. Don't hang up.

324
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,437
NARCOTICS TEAM 1

325
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,022
Why are you here?

326
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,402
Don't let anyone in, damn it.

327
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,699
-Changoo is still under interrogation.
-I know that, sir.

328
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,035
-Then, what is it?
-I was transferred here.

329
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,745
Damn it.

330
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,122
It's the narc.

331
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,832
Stop the "narc."

332
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,250
Damn it.

333
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,668
Who's this?

334
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,795
Corporal Oh, you're here.

335
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,672
Go in. Come on.

336
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,257
Captain. But…

337
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,926
-That's your seat.
-I'll call you back.

338
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,886
Yes, sir.

339
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:21,888
What…

340
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,309
Captain.

341
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,270
You joined our team?

342
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:30,354
What's going on?

343
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,314
Your partner.

344
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,151
I can't work with her.
Junho's leg hasn't even healed yet.

345
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:39,197
That wasn't her fault.
You just clashed during an investigation.

346
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,574
Exactly. It's a bad sign.

347
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,867
That girl for my partner…

348
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,620
Do you want me to carry her on my back?

349
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,748
I took her in
because she's capable and tenacious.

350
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,249
She wants to catch someone.

351
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,836
Who doesn't?

352
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,465
Keep an eye on her
and see whether she'll last.

353
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,592
She won't last a month.

354
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,093
Did you look into the candy?

355
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,263
Yes.

356
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,099
Changoo sang. He says Mango has it.

357
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,392
Bring him in.

358
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,727
Yes, sir.

359
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,813
We don't have time. The boat came in.

360
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,907
I can't log in.

361
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,118
Our system is different,
so you need to be registered.

362
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,787
Why do you want to log in?

363
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,082
I need to know
the status of the investigation.

364
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:34,043
I see. The status of the investigation.

365
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,964
The status of the six-month undercover
investigation that some idiot ruined?

366
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,467
I'm sorry about that.

367
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,261
I'll get you registered.

368
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,222
Why bother? She won't last long.

369
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,060
What should I do?

370
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,564
I don't know.

371
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,234
What should I do with you?

372
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,285
Hey.

373
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,328
There?

374
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,038
Got it.

375
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:13,624
Let's go.

376
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,252
-What?
-Let's work.

377
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,212
Mango.

378
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:30,933
DEAD BODY OF BAE JUNGOO
CRIME SCENE PHOTOS

379
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,685
SUICIDE NOTE FOUND WITH BODY

380
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,062
MY DEAR WIFE AND DAUGHTER
I'M SORRY FOR LEAVING YOU

381
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:44,739
This is Cha Giho.

382
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,701
I believe Choi Mujin
will make his move soon.

383
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,425
Yamamoto wants to make a deal.

384
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,137
How big?

385
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,514
The first transaction
will be 50 billion won.

386
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,852
Should I refuse?

387
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,606
It will be a problem
if we can't keep up with demand.

388
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,984
They found Mr. Bae.

389
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,614
I'll go personally next week.

390
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:32,036
I haven't seen that tumbler before.

391
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,705
It's chamomile tea.

392
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,958
Chamomile tea?

393
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,628
Good work, Ms. Kang.

394
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,725
Jiwoo joined Narcotics.

395
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,853
It'll help the organization.

396
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,898
Do you trust her?

397
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,652
I don't trust her.

398
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,489
I trust her desperation.

399
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,535
Jiwoo will become our dagger.

400
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,037
If things go south,
we'll have to kill her.

401
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,835
Yes, we will.

402
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,065
Gosh. I can't stand it.

403
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,651
Just my damn luck.

404
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,158
The owner goes by "Mango."

405
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,826
Go bring him out.

406
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,955
What's the charge?

407
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,459
There's no need to read him his rights.
Just bring him.

408
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:04,378
Go.

409
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,759
Damn it…

410
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,732
Excuse me, who are you?

411
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,110
I'm here to see the boss.

412
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,154
I see.

413
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,448
Are you his new girl?

414
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,910
That's not my thing.

415
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:38,954
Where's Mango?

416
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,247
He's not here. Leave.

417
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:43,459
-Keep your hands to yourself.
-Just go--

418
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,966
Hey. Get out.

419
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,059
Pildo. Did the rookie go in?

420
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,437
Yes. Mango will run out holding the drugs.
Get ready.

421
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,294
Who are you? Damn it…

422
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,359
What's taking so long?

423
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:51,944
How long has it been?

424
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:54,822
Let's go in.

425
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,311
What the…

426
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,353
What…

427
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,896
What in the…

428
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,733
Is he dead? Pildo.

429
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,210
Hey, my arm! My arm!

430
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,591
My arm!

431
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:56,508
Shit!

432
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:57,653
