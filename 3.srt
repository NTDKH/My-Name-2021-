1
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,898
My arm!

2
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,987
-What is this all of a sudden?
-I guess she won't slow us down.

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,029
Get up.

4
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,698
-Hey. Mango.
-Damn it!

5
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,159
You'll get nowhere in life like this.

6
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:35,076
That hurts.

7
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,911
What is this about?

8
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,705
She's my partner.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,415
Let him go.

10
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,211
Release him.

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,507
Fucking hell…

12
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,385
Watch your mouth.

13
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,596
My partner was just saying hi.

14
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,808
You've got guts,

15
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,353
but no finesse.

16
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,819
What do you want?

17
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,447
Do you have a warrant?

18
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,700
No. I don't have a warrant.

19
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:20,705
Gosh. You're famous
for having pea-sized balls,

20
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,917
but you attack a cop and demand a warrant.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,920
Seeing how you act,
the drugs must be here, right?

22
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,508
What… What drugs?

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,344
You're stuttering now. How adorable.

24
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,262
You know.

25
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,181
The tiny…

26
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,516
…black ones.

27
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,727
Whose money is all of this?

28
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,437
Maybe I should go ask the gamblers.

29
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,105
I wonder if they're winning.

30
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,357
Wait!

31
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,442
Stay still.

32
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,279
You can't even handle one person.

33
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,907
Even if you're a cop, you can't do this.

34
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,201
Yes, we can. To an asshole like you.

35
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,244
Move.

36
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,663
-Everyone, freeze!
-Get out of here.

37
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,665
-This is the police!
-Wait!

38
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:09,045
Leave all the money on the table
and show me some ID!

39
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,589
-Come on, now.
-Fold your hands.

40
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,050
-Stay seated.
-Detective.

41
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,219
Detective Jeon Pildo!

42
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,473
Why are you doing this?

43
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,767
Where'd you hide the drugs?

44
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,187
I have no idea
what drugs you're talking about.

45
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,440
We don't even have Tylenol here.

46
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,693
Didn't you hide it there last time?

47
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,031
You hid it up there last time too.

48
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,324
You hid it high up.

49
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,742
You short runt. Let's go.

50
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,329
This isn't a pharmacy.

51
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,123
I can't even reach that.

52
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,834
There's nothing there!
Why do you keep looking?

53
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,586
-Little shit.
-My gosh.

54
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,422
-Isn't this obstructing a business?
-Hey.

55
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:54,591
I'm the one that needs drugs.

56
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,219
What…

57
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,178
But…

58
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,015
That asshole.

59
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,660
This fucking sucks.

60
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,078
-Get over here.
-Yes, sir.

61
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,040
-Get over here, asshole. Look.
-Okay. Hold on a minute.

62
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,250
Asshole.

63
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm so screwed.

64
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,634
Take it easy. I'm injured.

65
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,053
Come on!

66
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,305
Gosh!

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,184
Damn…

68
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,437
Hey. I was just…

69
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,773
I told you to bring Mango out,

70
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,399
not wipe everyone out.

71
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,193
They wouldn't listen.

72
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,363
It wasn't because you wanted to show me
how tough you are?

73
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,160
Didn't you want to see what I could do?

74
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,830
Don't do that again.

75
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,294
You weren't even wearing a stab vest.

76
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,422
We're not like your previous team.

77
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,133
Yes, sir.

78
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,598
Where did you get this?

79
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:29,936
Detective Oh isn't a complete flake.

80
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,188
It was just a gift.

81
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,190
It's a sample someone gave me.

82
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:37,068
So who gave it to you?

83
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,870
-Send it to Forensics.
-Yes, sir.

84
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,582
Mango.

85
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,169
How many years
do you think you'll get this time?

86
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,089
Is this guy your best friend or something?

87
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,632
Damn it.

88
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,724
He is…

89
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,852
a really brutal one.

90
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,160
Why did the gods create drugs?

91
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,247
As the last sliver of hope

92
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,459
from Pandora's Box?

93
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,377
No.

94
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,339
They're drugs.

95
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,594
War, death, poverty, disease.

96
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,264
Why endure them when we can forget?

97
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,061
Put this in your mouth.

98
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,189
Your fears melt away
and you become a superhero.

99
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,650
It doesn't leave a trace in your body.

100
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,570
It's a gift from the gods.

101
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,908
That's an enticing offer.

102
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:10,745
But Choi Mujin won't stand for it.

103
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,792
Meth is a thing of the past now.

104
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,677
Get yourselves a black suit.

105
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,847
There's going to be a funeral soon.

106
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:34,769
Mango was arrested.

107
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,021
Was he?

108
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,357
He had a new drug.

109
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:41,567
And Narcotics is after it.

110
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,070
Where did it come from?

111
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:45,780
I don't know yet.

112
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,740
I'll look into it.

113
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:48,825
Okay.

114
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,538
Call in Mr. Jung.

115
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,755
I registered you into the system.

116
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,675
Okay.

117
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,176
Thanks.

You haven't left yet?

No, sir.

133
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,505
I hear there's a new drug.

134
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:09,423
Yes, sir.

135
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:10,967
There are rumors.

136
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,223
We couldn't distribute for three weeks
because of Mr. Bae.

137
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,184
Did a new drug ring come about
during that time?

138
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,186
I'll look into it.

139
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,563
There's no need.

140
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,565
Jiwoo will find it.

141
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,071
I'VE ARRIVED IN TOKYO. YOU MUST MEET
DEADLINES ONCE THE DEAL IS MADE.

142
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,699
What about the factory?

143
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,492
We've secured it.

144
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,286
-Where is it?
-North Port.

145
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,249
I'll check for myself.

146
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,884
Nice to meet you. I am Kang Suyeon.

147
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:59,432
Our chairman
would have come personally, but…

148
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,479
Then, shall we get to business?

149
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,041
It's the best quality product
on the market right now.

150
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:30,421
We call them "Diamonds."

151
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,549
It is of top quality.

152
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,191
We'll take them.
Bring the goods here in ten days.

153
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,777
Yes, sir. Understood.

154
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,431
Dang it. Carbs are fattening,
but why do they taste so good?

155
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,559
It's not what you eat.
You're just getting old.

156
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,937
Jerk. So you don't want it?

157
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,731
Come on. You lost the bet.

158
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,859
-Here, Detective Oh.
-Thank you.

160
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,825
Is this yours?

161
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,913
Aren't we going to question Mango more?

162
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,541
He's a damn weasel.
He needs to be holed up.

163
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,543
He'll start talking when we lose interest.

164
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,962
What about the investigation?

165
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,588
Hey.

166
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,342
What's the first
qualification to being a cop?

167
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:03,431
In Narcotics, wouldn't it be intel
or something similar?

168
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,473
Wrong.

169
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,641
Patience.

170
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,103
If you wait, you'll catch them.

171
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,480
Dig in.

172
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,910
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

173
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,343
Captain. The target's on the move.

174
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,679
Let's go.

175
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,849
Call for backup.

176
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:47,850
Yes, sir.

177
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,936
-Let's go.
-We're heading out, sir.

178
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,108
Serial number K2017-3154.
Corporal Oh Hyejin.

179
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,622
Okay. Hand in your cell phones.

180
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:24,929
Tonight,

181
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,806
our target is…

182
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,896
Choi Mujin.

183
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,449
Choi Mujin.

184
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,452
On the surface, he's CEO of Hotel Liber,

185
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,247
but he's the boss of Dongcheon,
the largest drug ring

186
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,291
that supplies 90 percent
of the meth in the nation.

187
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:59,255
Their middle man Bae Jungoo, the CEO
of a shipping firm, committed suicide.

188
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,883
A ship owned by Bae
arrived from Thailand two days ago.

189
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,677
Choi Mujin took over that factory.

190
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,305
It is located in North Port Section K.

191
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,850
Choi Mujin will arrive in 50 minutes.

192
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:16,105
Teams One and Two will go in under
Narcotics' orders. The rest will back up.

193
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,731
HOTEL LIBER CHOI MUJIN, MONITOR 1

194
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,070
Don't worry about anyone else.

195
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,073
Our target is Choi Mujin.

196
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,616
Understand?

197
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,326
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,662
Move out.

199
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,418
Let's go.

200
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,517
Here's your body cam.

201
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,644
Make sure to back up the data.

202
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:01,984
Hey. Make sure we get Choi Mujin
and the evidence. Okay?

203
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,319
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

204
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,322
Don't be nervous. You'll get hurt.

205
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,814
We're going radio silent now.

206
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,099
Hold positions and standby.

207
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,728
Thank you for coming.

208
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:23,732
-Is the lab down there?
-Yes.

209
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:27,027
We load the raw materials in Thailand
and manufacture at sea.

210
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,612
Please come this way.

211
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,632
Team One, in position.

212
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,719
Team Two, in position.
Choi Mujin confirmed on the ship.

213
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,971
Infiltrate.

214
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,647
Move!

215
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,857
Get him! Don't let him get away!

216
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,556
They're just crewmen.

217
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,724
They say they don't know anything
about a meth lab.

218
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,934
Keep going in.

219
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:04,935
We'll continue in.

220
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,865
The target is Choi Mujin.

221
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,909
Get evidence at all costs.

222
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,932
What's going on?

223
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,059
Hey, Pildo!

224
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:32,064
There's a situation with Pildo.
Team Two, move to Team One now.

225
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,733
-Yes, sir.
-We won't be short on supply again.

226
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,653
Mr. Bae was smart.

227
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,534
Send the goods to Yamamoto.

228
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,494
Yes, sir.

229
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,373
Freeze, Choi Mujin!

230
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,626
Put that knife down.

231
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,586
Stop!

232
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,173
Choi Mujin, you're under arrest
for the manufacture of illegal drugs.

233
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,009
Don't do it, Jung Taeju!

234
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,596
Pildo, are you okay? Who fired that shot?

235
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,603
Pildo. Pildo!

236
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:54,896
Freeze, Choi Mujin!

237
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,281
Get Choi Mujin. Get him!

238
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,992
Freeze, Choi Mujin!

239
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,258
Choi Mujin is escaping!

240
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,436
Follow me.

241
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,571
-Where's Choi Mujin?
-Choi Mujin?

242
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,572
Find him.

243
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,033
-Find Choi Mujin!
-Let's go find him.

244
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,272
No?

245
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,818
-You.
-Yes?

246
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,069
Check inside again.

247
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:24,986
Yes, sir.

248
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,410
Did you see who fired the shot?

249
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,966
Damn it. With that crack,
we can't even use it as evidence.

250
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,012
Captain. Over here.

251
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,647
Captain.

252
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,767
Shit!

253
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,082
Cha Giho was after me.

254
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,251
They showed no signs of movement--

255
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,585
Taeju.

256
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,756
Who are we?

257
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:55,011
Did you forget who we are because of
the designer suits and executive titles?

258
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,098
I'm sorry.

259
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,435
Find out who the rat is.

260
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,187
Yes, sir.

261
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,440
But…

262
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,278
why didn't Jiwoo contact us?

263
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:30,005
We checked, and no one from our team
discharged their firearm.

264
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:31,798
Really?

265
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,761
Good work today. Captain Lee.

INCOMING CALL

269

CALL ENDED

271
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,016
Look at this.

272
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,059
Look.

273
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,645
You and Choi Mujin were talking.

274
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,271
I saw you.

275
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,774
Choi Mujin was there!

276
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,319
I don't know anything.

277
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,364
This fucking jerk…

278
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,074
Get over here.

279
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,534
Get over here.

280
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,828
-What the hell?
-Hey! Detectives!

281
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,497
-Pildo, let go!
-I saw you.

282
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,165
Talk, you bastard.

283
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,762
-Everyone take out your guns.
-What?

284
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:44,764
What…

285
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,941
Captain. Even us?

286
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,569
Captain.

287
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,326
Sir. It wasn't us.

288
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,142
Return your firearms.

289
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,938
What the hell is going on?

290
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,858
Shit.

291
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,240
Shit.

292
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,409
Was going after
Park Changoo and Mango a fake?

293
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,790
We went after small fry and
waited for Choi Mujin to drop his guard.

294
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,167
So he was the target from the get-go.

295
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,085
Because we had to catch him in the act!

296
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:06,930
Choi Mujin.

297
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,808
He became the boss
of Dongcheon 11 years ago.

298
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:12,936
Drug production and distribution,
assault, and even murder.

299
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:16,231
He was the main suspect
in numerous cases but was never indicted.

300
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,193
We never had enough evidence
and others always took the fall.

301
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,700
YOON DONGHOON
DIED IN 2016

302
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,789
Yoon Donghoon.

303
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:36,543
He was Choi Mujin's closest friend.
He was murdered five years ago.

304
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,631
Who killed him?

305
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,757
We never caught him.

306
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:44,968
We never found the murder weapon.

307
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,428
-But--
-What happened?

308
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,980
You didn't bring a shred of evidence
and burned down the ship?

309
00:30:58,189 --> 00:30:59,065
Cha Giho.

310
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,984
What do you think you're doing?

311
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:02,944
I'm sorry, sir.

312
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,155
I told you not to act on your emotions.

313
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,157
What will you do about this?

314
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,119
We have to catch Choi Mujin.

315
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,789
We have to bring him down!

316
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,798
All of you, keep your mouths shut.

317
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,552
If this gets out, we're all dead.

318
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,810
Shape up.

319
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,843
Can we catch that asshole Choi Mujin?

320
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,348
Who the heck fired that gun?

321
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,561
How long have you been after him?

322
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,273
Since before I joined Narcotics,
so over four years.

323
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:25,401
Why is Captain after him?

324
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,361
Why else?

325
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,155
Because he's the biggest drug ring,
of course.

326
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:34,077
Do you know how many drugs
Dongcheon distributes yearly?

327
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,454
Captain has his own reasons.

328
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:43,127
A rookie from Narcotics died a while back.

329
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,713
I think it was around the year 2004…

330
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:09,404
So from then until now…

331
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,321
Yes.

332
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,073
Imagine how Captain…

333
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,243
How Giho must feel right now.

334
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,415
What do we do now?

335
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,083
What else?

336
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,544
We prepare and attack again.

337
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,297
Until we take down the Dongcheon assholes.

338
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,259
Here.

339
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,137
How are you so chill?

340
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,307
Junho. Over here.

341
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,393
Junho.

342
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,602
What? Junho's here?

343
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,479
-Yes. Hello.
-I need to make a call.

344
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,731
Sure.

345
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,732
Sit down.

346
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,984
-Hey, kid. You okay?
-Yes, I am.

347
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,902
-I'm glad you came.
-Thanks.

348
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:50,987
Another glass, please!

349
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,281
That looks good.

350
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,699
Hey, eat up.

351
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,288
Are you okay?

352
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,836
It was an ambush,
so I didn't know in advance.

353
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,380
Is there a tail on me?

354
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,049
No.

355
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,095
There are cameras in the hotel.

356
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,056
The hallway at the penthouse entrance.

357
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,558
The basement elevator entrance.
The garage exit.

358
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,810
There are three cameras in those places.

359
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,900
Which means we have a mole.

360
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,319
I'll look into it.

361
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,573
Did you shoot the gun?

362
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,243
I had no way of contacting you.

363
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,705
And I always…

364
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,419
planned to use the gun at a crime scene.

365
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,423
The truth will come out now…

366
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,470
since I left the gun there.

367
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,550
You know Junho, right?

368
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,677
You sent him on vacation.

369
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,347
We'll all work together
once you return. Right?

370
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,432
Let's drink.

371
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,475
Punks.

372
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,769
-Cheers.
-Gosh.

373
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,132
What?

374
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,511
Sir.

375
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,512
What?

376
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:23,556
What?

377
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,349
Hey.

378
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,018
What going on?

379
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:33,232
-Why?
-Damn it.

380
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,074
We've been spotted.

381
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,873
Hey!

382
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,543
You ready?

383
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,505
Fuck, I've been ready for five years!

384
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:55,082
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

385
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,915
-What?
-Get out of the way!

386
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,594
This place hasn't changed at all.

387
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,473
Mr. Jung!

388
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,600
It's me!

389
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,728
Kill them all.

390
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,696
You son of a bitch!

391
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,369
You son of a bitch.

392
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:27,633
Shit!

393
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:22,354
It's been so long, Taeju. I should say hi.

394
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,149
You asshole.

395
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,901
Do you really think--

396
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,903
Hey! You're hurting my feelings.

397
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,948
Come on.

398
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,494
Aren't you glad to see me?

399
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,749
Stop it!

400
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,754
You motherfucker!

401
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,255
Damn it.

402
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,762
"Kill me if you want."

403
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,641
That's the look on your face.

404
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,894
I won't kill you.

405
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:03,938
Relax.

406
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,695
Face.

407
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,989
Arm.

408
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,450
Leg.

409
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,037
Choose one. Just one.

410
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,083
You can't choose, can you?

411
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,088
I couldn't either.

412
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,062
THE POWER OF SCIENCE REVEALS THE TRUTH

413
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:52,444
Damn it.

414
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,613
Hey. Call me.

415
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,634
Where are you?

416
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,344
I'm home.

417
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,762
Come to the Dongcheon gym.

418
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,530
Stand up straight.

419
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:20,991
How could you not see who attacked you?
Are you kidding me?

420
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,201
Go on in.

421
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:24,995
Jung Taeju.

422
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,498
You really won't talk?

423
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,041
Well?

424
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,559
I'M BACK

425
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,103
I don't know who it was,

426
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,814
but someone wrecked
Dongcheon's muscle team.

427
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,983
Three died
and one is in critical condition.

428
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,238
Was Choi Mujin killed?

429
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:07,598
