1
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,569
Was Choi Mujin killed?

2
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,741
No.

3
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,993
He wasn't here.

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,623
No.

5
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,583
We're fine.

6
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,127
Thank you.

7
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,142
Ms. Kang.

8
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,560
Yes.

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:01,978
Should we prepare ourselves?

10
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,605
We are not

11
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,316
affiliated with the gym
in any official manner.

12
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,776
Exactly.

13
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,156
Don't give the cops anything.
Make sure no one talks.

14
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,240
Yes, sir.

15
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,663
Did you look into it?

16
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,956
They say it didn't record.

17
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,168
That's bullshit.
Look how many cameras they have.

18
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,463
Gangs don't trust the police.

19
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,117
Is this the only camera here?

20
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,077
Yes, that's right. This is the only one.

21
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,966
Is this delivery truck
assigned to this area?

22
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,636
Please let me know if you hear anything.

23
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,554
I will.

24
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,157
Let's go that way.

25
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,329
None of the victims are talking.

26
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:46,374
I wonder who came back.

27
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,335
Were you scared?

28
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,172
It must've been your first time.

29
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,634
It's been a while for me too.

30
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,263
There hasn't been anyone
this ballsy before.

31
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,766
DO NOT ENTER
UNDER INVESTIGATION

32
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,185
But don't be scared.

33
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,270
We're cops.

34
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,731
I'm not scared.

35
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,108
I'm sure.

36
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:17,655
Yes?

37
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,826
On my way, sir.

38
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,579
Ask around more. I have to go.

39
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:44,224
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, SIR?

40
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,173
Pildo.

41
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,175
What are you doing?

42
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,603
We're in mourning.

43
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,897
Yes, we know.

44
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,608
We came to pay our respects, punk.

45
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,946
Out of my way.

46
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,880
Just one will be enough.

47
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,342
Fine.

48
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,928
We didn't bring condolence money anyway.

49
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,101
That must hurt.

50
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,213
Give me a drink too.

51
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,707
A dog's fate…

52
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,044
follows its master's.

53
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,714
The same dog can live in luxury

54
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,842
if it lucks out with a good master,

55
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,595
or it can die on the street.

56
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:11,931
It's a dog's death.

57
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,602
It must be nice being a cop.

58
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:22,108
Even incompetent louses like you
can become captains.

59
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:27,738
You would've been stabbed to death
long ago if you were in our world.

60
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,747
I'm sick of this too.

61
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,959
Let's put an end to it soon.

62
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,591
How do you think you'll go out?

63
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,597
Why would I think about that?

64
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,648
I only know one thing.

65
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,448
That you can't catch me
no matter what you do.

66
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:18,789
Hey.

67
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,667
What are you all doing here?

68
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:23,961
Here.

69
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,714
Let me know if you ever want to talk.

70
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,467
Don't you want to talk?

71
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,636
I'm sure you have lots to say.

72
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,531
Think long and hard.

73
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,033
You guys can't catch them anyway.

74
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,620
Let's go, Detective Jeon.

75
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,039
See you around.

76
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:13,302
Where is that bitch hiding anyway?

77
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:16,472
I'll let you have a taste once we get her.

78
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,683
What the hell? Are you drunk?

79
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:20,309
My bad.

80
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,394
You can't

81
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,396
do it anymore, right?

82
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,481
You motherfucker.

83
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:28,442
So let's catch that bitch

84
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,778
and kill her.

85
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,242
Why are we not getting buyers?

86
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,660
We gave out so many!

87
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,289
Should I call Mango?

88
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,042
Is Mango getting funny ideas?

89
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,672
Tear him apart!

90
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:03,019
DONGCHEON’S CHOI MUJIN STING OPERATION
BALLISTICS FORENSICS ANALYSIS REQUEST

91
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,858
Good work, sir.

92
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,818
Find anything?

93
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,486
No.

94
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,779
Sergeant Jeon!

95
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,364
Hello.

96
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,992
Hey, search this.

97
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,328
Did you find anything?

98
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,415
We have no witnesses or footage.
It'll be hard to identify suspects.

99
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,418
Pildo. Who am I?

100
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,295
Gosh.

101
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,091
This is the kind of guy I am!

102
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,888
It's from a delivery van dashcam.

103
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,974
I went all the way to Seongan
to track down the driver.

104
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,517
Who is this?

105
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,311
He looks familiar. Let's look him up.

106
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,356
Why did you come here?

107
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,649
A girl.

108
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,034
Captain, doesn't he look familiar?

109
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,622
Do Gangjae, this asshole
used to be in Dongcheon.

110
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:07,041
He suddenly disappeared four years ago.

111
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,793
But he's back.

112
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,170
Did something happen back then?

113
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,090
There was a rumor
that someone died at the gym.

114
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,636
How will Choi Mujin react?

115
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:22,264
We're after him,
so he'll probably stay low, right?

116
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,435
He can't do that.

117
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,188
Choi Mujin

118
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,273
had his pride hurt.

119
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,238
Find Gangjae.

120
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,157
Making a move now is dangerous.

121
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,121
Are you afraid?

122
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,915
No, sir.

123
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,004
If we don't retaliate,
the organization will crumble.

124
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,884
I have to show them who I am
and what Dongcheon

125
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,846
is all about.

126
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,147
First,

127
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,191
let Mango go.

128
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,276
-What?
-What?

129
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,111
Let's see what Choi Mujin does.

130
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,947
What about Do Gangjae?

131
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,490
Should we put out an APB?

132
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,033
You'll just let him be?

133
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,161
No. Just for the time being.

134
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,080
We'll get Choi Mujin…

135
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,875
while Gangjae has him rattled.

136
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,003
Four people have died.

137
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,215
If the two gangs collide, more will die.

138
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,300
Does it…

139
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:44,138
not matter how many gang members die?

140
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,433
Those assholes can die.

141
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,689
Let's get Choi Mujin first.

142
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,192
Oh, boy.

143
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,794
MANGO IS BEING RELEASED.
IT'S A TRAP.

144
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,367
-The Musan branch has arrived.
-Get them ready.

145
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,792
The other organizations
are awaiting your instructions.

146
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,256
Send them all away.

147
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,217
Pardon?

148
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,804
Is there anyone you trust?

149
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:09,765
Yes.

150
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,102
Cha Giho is trying to play me,

151
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,730
so I'll play.

152
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,382
-You saved the best for yourself.
-You can have it.

153
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,383
Gosh.

154
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:45,551
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

155
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,511
Hey.

156
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,515
Any word from the team
monitoring Dongcheon?

157
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:52,933
They're quiet.

158
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,144
Our guys are going around gathering intel,

159
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,979
but they haven't located Gangjae yet.

160
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,648
Maybe they're getting help
from other organizations?

161
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,442
No.

162
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,904
Choi Mujin will act personally.

163
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,742
But…

164
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,539
they may be crumbling from within.

165
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,540
What?

166
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,669
I think one of them will flip for us.

167
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,754
What…

168
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,047
Who's that?

169
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,131
I don't know yet.

170
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,216
I'll meet him later.

171
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,801
Pildo.

172
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,470
Yes, sir.

173
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,097
Later? When?

174
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,724
Where are you meeting him?

175
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,229
What should we do about Yamamoto?

176
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,649
Tell him to wait for now.

177
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,193
To build a new factory
and get new chemists,

178
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,402
it'll take too long.

179
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,863
The buyers are nervous too.

180
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,531
You go to the buyers.

181
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,200
Yes, sir.

182
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,119
You said someone is circulating
a new drug.

183
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,747
I bet that's Gangjae.

184
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:01,460
He wants to kill me
and take over the market.

185
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:03,963
So…

186
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,592
if we get him, we also get his drugs.

187
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,888
Yes, sir.

188
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,233
A TRAITOR IS MEETING CHA GIHO.
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

189
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,255
It's hard for us to keep waiting.
That's what I'm saying.

190
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,841
How long can we wait without drugs?

191
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,552
Gangjae's gang is a problem,

192
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,804
but even Narcotics is after you.

193
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,807
Whose side should we take

194
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,685
if a turf war breaks out?

195
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,187
Are you saying

196
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,940
you'll place bets on who wins?

197
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,117
Fine. Do that then.

198
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,870
But keep this in mind.

199
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,080
The buy-in

200
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,124
is your life.

201
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,389
Keep watching them.

202
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,432
Yes, sir.

203
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,277
You seem to know who I am.
Let me see your…

204
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:08,243
So,

205
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,705
Choi Mujin really did plant someone
among us.

206
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,583
Pildo.

207
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,338
Keep a close eye on Detective Oh Hyejin.

208
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,466
Ever since she came,

209
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,926
our intel has been leaking.

210
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,179
If she's their informant, that means

211
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,140
they removed the cameras
as soon as she found out.

212
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,101
Would they have risked blowing her cover?

213
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,187
What if they did it because they knew

214
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,023
we'd think that?

215
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:43,904
Let's go.

216
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,077
Go on.

217
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,708
It was a trap.

218
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,294
Was Cha Giho trying to catch my informant?

219
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,129
But…

220
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,258
Jung Taeju was there.

221
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,689
Don't do anything for the time being.

222
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,818
Cha Giho is waiting
for the organization to take action.

223
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,780
I'll find Gangjae myself.

224
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,831
I've calmed down the buyers for now.

225
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:46,550
You may go.

226
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,596
Yes, sir.

227
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,330
I'LL TELL YOU WHERE GANGJAE IS
DONGMYO PARK 11 P.M.

228
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,048
Pildo.

229
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:27,966
Yes.

230
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,553
It's Detective Oh's file.

231
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,722
Captain.

232
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,641
Why did you call out Jung Taeju?

233
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,645
They planted a spy among us,

234
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,023
so I just threw a stone.

235
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,902
Let's see how far the ripples go.

236
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,362
Keep it up.

237
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:50,947
Good night, sir.

238
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,436

240
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:30,654
THREW HIMSELF INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC.
AUTOPSY REVEALS HE WAS USING METH.

INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

242
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,171
This is my knife.

243
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,674
Kill him as soon as you find him.

244
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,901
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

245
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,992
I'm Oh Hyejin from Inchang Narcotics.

246
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,244
Is the ballistic report ready?

247
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,705
Yes. I just notified your captain.

248
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,626
To whom was the gun issued?

249
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,630
We can't determine that here.
But we restored the gun's serial number.

250
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:23,016
SERIAL NUMBER IS GL86575

251
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,020

ADMINISTRATION DEPARTMENT

253
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,319
Choi Mujin left a gun at the scene.

254
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,154
Why?

255
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,739
Why now?

256
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,325
He's probably trying to bait me

257
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,245
since he thought it was a cop's gun.

258
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,963
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY
GUN SERIAL NUMBER ANALYSIS REPORT

259
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,100
Who is Song Joonsu?

260
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,276
We got the gun analysis report.

261
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,070
I confirmed it with Administration.

262
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,034
You picked it up?

263
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,080
The gun was issued
to Corporal Song Joonsu in 2004.

264
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,208
Records show he was with Narcotics.

265
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:14,711
Who is he?

266
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,678
He used to be on the team.

267
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,474
He died less than a month
after joining Narcotics.

268
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,478
Was Dongcheon involved?

269
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:38,151
Dongcheon killed him.

270
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,370
So the gun belonged to…

271
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,914
NAME: SONG JOONSU
SERIAL: GL86575

272
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,374
…the dead Narcotics agent
that Daesoo mentioned?

273
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,710
DIED DURING OPERATION,
GUN WAS NOT RECOVERED

274
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:59,005
SUPERVISOR IN CHARGE
NARCOTICS TEAM 1, LIEUTENANT CHA GIHO

275
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,205
Did Dongcheon ever kill a cop?

276
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,876
The gun belonged to a cop
who died long ago.

277
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,338
Cha Giho says that cop was murdered
while following Dongcheon…

278
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:41,506
That did not happen.

279
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,425
The organization doesn't kill cops.

280
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,804
Cha Giho has been after me for years

281
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,931
and crossed the line years ago.

282
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:53,017
He appeased, deceived, and entrapped us.

283
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,061
He did anything he could.

284
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,523
But now that the gun has surfaced,

285
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,484
he's playing dirty tricks.

286
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,863
Don't fall for it.

287
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,540
I'm telling the truth.

288
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,334
The cops took it all.

289
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,967
You know,

290
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,386
there aren't…

291
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,596
Yes, Gangjae?

292
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,680
…many people

293
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,268
in this world that I like.

294
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:37,228
I especially…

295
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,567
can't stand assholes that lie.

296
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,780
But who doesn't lie in this line of work?

297
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,158
It's a world full of bad guys.

298
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,997
if you're going to lie,

299
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,250
-put more thought into it.
-That's not it, Gangjae…

300
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,758
You need to show sincerity.

301
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,891
SONG JOONSU DEATH REPORT

302
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,018
HE WAS A CIVIL SERVANT.
WHILE TRACKING THE ROUTE OF

303
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,063
DONGCHEON'S NEW DRUG,
HE FOUND AN IMPORTANT CLUE

304
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,148
TO CHOI MUJIN.
AND DURING INVESTIGATION…

305
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,192
What does it say?

306
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,027
-Daesoo.
-Yes?

307
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,779
Gangjae's and Mango's are the same.

308
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,405
-LSD?
-Yes.

309
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,323
Hold on.

310
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,283
Goodness.

311
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,206
Put it on my desk.

312
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:41,960
Detective Oh.

313
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,629
What are you doing later?

314
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,174
Why?

315
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,468
Want to grab some soju?

316
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,473
I have plans.

317
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,601
Okay, then.

318
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,028
"Want to grab some soju?"

319
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,614
Rejected! Gosh.

320
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,533
She's not easy.

321
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,452
Buy me soju instead!

322
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,538
Geonpyeong.

323
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,039
"Want to grab some whiskey?"

324
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,187
Have you heard of Do Gangjae or his drugs?

325
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,099
What are you doing here?

326
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,519
And what are you doing here?

327
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,520
Answer me.

328
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,859
-I was watching Mango.
-Exactly. Why?

329
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,488
The drugs found at the gym
and the ones Mango had are the same.

330
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,572
I know that.

331
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,993
I'm asking why you're on your own.

332
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,624
Because dangerous assholes have
a new drug but no one is investigating.

333
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:30,795
Is that really all?

334
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,732
I'm going to find Gangjae.

335
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,695
Act on your own again,
and you'll regret it.

336
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:57,905
Go after him.

337
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:16,966
Have a good night.

338
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,968
-Thank you.
-Come again.

339
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,309
Hi, you're here.

340
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,944
You come often lately.

341
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:37,862
Yes.

342
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,281
-Spicy fish stew and soju?
-Yes, please.

343
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,835
Yes?

344
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,421
Okay.

345
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,050
Beomya-ro 261.

346
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,521
Okay.

347
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,236
This factory shut down last month.

348
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,333
Why are you trying so hard?

349
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,378
You're tailing a druggie
on a Friday night.

350
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:21,382
-Don't you have any friends?
-What about you?

351
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,099
You're doing this

352
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,310
because of your dad, right?

353
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:39,942
Hello.

354
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,529
I forgot my cigarettes.

355
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,491
Would you go buy me a pack?

356
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:52,872
Buy them please.

357
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,685
Your dad was an addict, wasn't he?

358
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,522
He was high when he was in that accident.

359
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,443
You want to catch someone.

360
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,154
Who is that?

361
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,542
Why did he just give it to him?

362
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,507
I don't see his thugs.

363
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,802
You little shit.

364
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,888
Where's Gangjae?

365
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,184
Where's Do Gangjae?

366
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:03,622
A fortune teller told me…

367
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,000
that it was

368
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,502
a very lucky year for me.

369
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,632
This is from our security camera.
She suddenly showed up,

370
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,259
beat up all my guys,

371
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,594
and took all the drugs.

372
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,554
That fucking narc.

373
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,849
Stop whining about some narc.
Shut the hell up.

374
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,684
What?

375
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:26,520
What is it?

376
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,230
Hey!

377
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,149
It's the fucking bitch!

378
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,865
Bang.

379
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,207
Oh Hyejin.

380
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:54,965
Detective Oh Hyejin.

381
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,141
It's good to see you,

382
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,227
you fucking bitch.

383
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:12,126
