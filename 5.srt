1
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,569
Uncuff me.

2
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:31,781
What?

3
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,994
You still can't beat me in a fair fight?

4
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,921
You still have that look in your eyes.

5
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,593
Like you fear nothing.

6
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,980
This expression I like.

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,237
Mango wasn't there.

8
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,197
Captain.

9
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,783
I can't reach Detective Jeon.

10
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:17,035
He asked me to look up a location…

11
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:17,994
And?

12
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,371
And his phone turned off right after.

13
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:31,925
Did you get him?

14
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,760
It's been a while, Gangjae.

15
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,891
Those morons.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,520
I knew you'd come here.

17
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:50,235
I didn't want to go empty-handed,
so I was preparing a gift for you.

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,363
Look here.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:57,075
OH HYEJIN

20
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,833
Hurry up.

21
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,334
There isn't much time.

22
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,170
If you want to at least get her corpse.

23
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:17,595
You thought you were something special,
didn't you?

24
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,514
You are

25
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,225
absolutely nothing.

26
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,644
Let Detective Jeon go.

27
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,689
He has nothing to do with this.

28
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:32,527
You…

29
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:38,366
just worry about
what I'm about to do to you.

30
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,828
I'll play with you all night long.

31
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,425
Damn it!

32
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,930
I wanted to kill you
in front of Choi Mujin!

33
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,392
Detective!

34
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,102
Say your final words.

35
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,187
I'll relay it for you.

36
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,026
I'm going to kill you.

37
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:23,953
Do it.

38
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,352
This must hurt like hell.

39
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,063
As you get crushed,

40
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,398
your skull will crack open

41
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,193
and your brain will ooze out.

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,240
It'll be quite the sight,

43
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,408
but I don't have the time.

44
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,120
Bye-bye.

45
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,341
Wake up, Pildo!

46
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,587
Gangjae!

47
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:52,852
Get out.

48
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,645
Get out now!

49
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:02,880
Hold on!

50
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,557
Pildo!

51
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,650
Pildo!

52
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:23,568
OH HYEJIN

53
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:31,534
Pildo!

54
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:33,619
My god.

55
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,163
-Pildo.
-Come on, Pildo.

56
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,414
I'm good.

57
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:37,540
Seriously.

58
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,667
Geez.

59
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,630
A detective getting handcuffed.

60
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,548
Good going.

61
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,217
You crazy bastard. Get up.

62
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,599
Why does it feel nice being insulted?

63
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,394
-You okay?
-Yes.

64
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,146
I'm okay.

65
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,564
-Hey!
-Hey!

66
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,980
Are you all right, sir?

67
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,947
Why did you go alone?

68
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,952
Gangjae tried to kill Jiwoo.

69
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,498
Just because of Jiwoo.

70
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,962
You could have died.

71
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,929
Jiwoo fired the shot on that ship.

72
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,894
She did it at the risk
of exposing her identity.

73
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,191
What did you do?

74
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,697
Taeju.

75
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,700
Taeju!

76
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,916
Can I trust you?

77
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,258
I'm sorry, sir.

78
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,148
She's in surgery right now. Hold on.

79
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,151
How long is the surgery?

80
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,028
We don't know yet.

81
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,363
We have to catch that asshole Gangjae.

82
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:17,116
You go get treated first.

83
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,287
We can catch punks
like Gangjae whenever we want.

84
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,205
That asshole stabbed my partner!

85
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,582
Jeon Pildo!

86
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,004
I choose to trust Detective Oh.

87
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:04,640
All Narcotics members will carry firearms
until the situation is resolved.

88
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,767
-Hello.
-Hello.

89
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,227
-Police.
-Yes.

90
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,564
May I take a look
at the video from that camera?

91
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,233
Have you seen this man?

92
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,527
Girls. Come over here.

93
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,862
You too.

94
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,575
They're Do Gangjae and Kim Cheolho.
Take a good look.

95
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,264
-Where's Gangjae?
-Shit, I don't know!

96
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:49,351
Fucker! Do you want to die? Shit.

97
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,104
-The result will be the same.
-Damn it.

98
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,398
We can end it quickly or drag it out.

99
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,941
It's your choice.

100
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,816
Let's not waste our energy.

101
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,454
What the hell, bastard!

102
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,081
You are under arrest
for obstruction of justice

103
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,252
-Stay still, assholes.
-Shit. You sons of bitches!

104
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,128
You have the right to remain silent.

105
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,881
You have the right to an attorney.
You have the right to remain silent.

106
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,966
But don't do that.

107
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,093
Because I'm pissed off.

108
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm sorry, sir. Gangjae…

109
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:00,107
Did you eat?

110
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,068
No, sir. Not yet.

111
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,862
Want to get samgyetang?

112
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:07,489
Sir?

113
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,617
We used to go there often.

114
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,076
Simakse.

115
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,703
Yes, sir.

116
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,545
Right.

117
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,964
You used to like their daughter.

118
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,133
No, sir.

119
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,801
So it didn't work out.

120
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,513
It really wasn't like that.

121
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:41,857
I know you're trying.

122
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,908
Let's see what Narcotics does.

123
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,537
Gangjae will show up
if he's driven to a corner.

124
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,289
Yes, sir.

125
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,763
Dad.

126
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:16,892
Dad!

127
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,655
Dad.

128
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,156
Dad?

129
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,325
Dad, open the door.

130
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,608
Dad.

131
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,986
Dad!

132
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,488
Dad! Don't go!

133
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,657
Please show me your face!

134
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,660
Dad!

135
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:21,040
Dad! Don't go!

136
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,958
Dad!

137
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,185
Are you okay?

138
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,986
You scowl even when you sleep.

139
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,034
You won't last long like that.

140
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,165
I lived for revenge like you too.

141
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,378
I had a little sister.

142
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,674
She went clubbing
to celebrate getting into college,

143
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,302
and someone drugged her beer.

144
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,597
She died on the spot.

145
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,310
She had a weak heart.

146
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,816
Did they catch him?

147
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,943
No.

148
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,445
I don't even know who it was.

149
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,950
If we catch all the drug dealers
and drug ring members,

150
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,160
he'll probably be among them.

151
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,543
I don't know whom you want to catch,

152
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,546
but I'll help you.

153
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,714
Let's catch him together.

154
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,142
Get dressed and come out.
I'll handle your discharge.

155
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,656
Are you okay?

156
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,410
Touch this.

157
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,454
Touch it.

158
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,251
Awesome, right?

159
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,422
The swelling won't go down.

160
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,926
They said a scooch over
and I would've died. Gosh.

161
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,721
You have a lot of scars on your hand.

162
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,894
Maybe because I was a coward.

163
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,524
Not anymore.

164
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,860
When I first joined Narcotics.

165
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,322
Whenever someone had a knife,

166
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,490
I used my hands.

167
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,815
Detective Oh! Hey.

168
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,068
Let's go inside. It's cold.

169
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:46,203
When you get stabbed,
you need to fill the hole with meat.

170
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,081
We're using our remaining
team outing budget here.

171
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,834
Hold on, Detective Oh
should drink something warm.

172
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,794
Here.

173
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,380
What's that?

174
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,548
I prepared chamomile tea.

175
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,550
Oh, Geonpyeong.

176
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,887
-Just grill the meat properly.
-Yes, sir.

177
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,138
Detective Oh's hungry.

178
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,474
Do you want it medium or well done?

179
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,895
Daesoo is too unrefined and
can't eat this unless it's fully cooked.

180
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:14,106
You punk. I eat beef tartare.

181
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,148
You punk.

182
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,985
Don't make her laugh. It still hurts.

183
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,027
Sorry.

184
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,159
I'm crazy happy you're back alive,

185
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,703
Hyejin.

186
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,709
Cheers.

187
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,967
Is this really Korean beef?

188
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,760
Grill the mushrooms too. There.

189
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:46,972
Flip this.

190
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,700
Hello, Mr. Choi. It's me.

191
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,952
I've located Jiwoo.

192
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,623
We need to send someone out.

193
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,711
Who is she?

194
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,176
A friend's daughter.

195
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,429
Book a flight
and find her a place to live.

196
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,099
A house on the beach.

197
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,062
Yes, sir.

198
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,342
CHOI MUJIN, CEO OF HOTEL LIBER
CHARGED FOR DRUGS AND ASSAULT, DONGCHEON

199
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,049
Wrap things up and leave.

200
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,094
I'll make it so you can leave the country.

201
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,221
I can't do that.

202
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:53,807
Jiwoo.

203
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,268
I still need to check something.

204
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,227
Yoon Jiwoo!

205
00:23:59,062 --> 00:23:59,980
Do as I say.

206
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,191
You'll be in danger
if Gangjae is arrested.

207
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,445
I'll take care of it.

208
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,219
Captain. You wanted to see me?

209
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,559
Find out every call this number made,

210
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,520
received, and its location
for the next three weeks.

211
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,230
Yes, sir.

212
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,232
OH HYEJIN

213
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,318
It's classified.

214
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,361
Yes, sir.

215
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,790
Gosh.

216
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,209
Get going.

217
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,335
Have a nice day.

218
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,670
I'll walk on my own.

219
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,256
-Sure.
-What? Hey.

220
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:12,093
Why are you here already?
You should take a few more days off.

221
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,553
I was getting stir crazy.

222
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,347
We'll catch Do Gangjae soon.

223
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:23,021
We got orders to carry firearms.
Go pick up your gun.

224
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,023
-Okay.
-I got it, punk.

225
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,441
Here. You forgot this.

226
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:27,817
-Thanks.
-Sure.

227
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:30,862
You came in.

228
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:32,906
Are you okay?

229
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,407
I'm fine.

230
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,910
Captain Cha.

231
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,204
Hey. Come in.

232
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,835
Jiwoo. Did you hear from your dad?

233
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,424
What did you say
to make him run right over?

234
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,763
OH HYEJIN

235
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,433
It's been so long.

236
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:04,938
Do you know each other?

237
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,234
Yes.

238
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,070
I saw her a few times
when she was with Violent Crimes.

239
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,364
She's a great worker.

240
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
Come in.

241
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,218
Detective Oh.

242
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,053
We should

243
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,180
grab dinner sometime.

244
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,121
About Yoon Donghoon's daughter…

245
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,666
Did you find anything?

246
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,212
No, there's no trace of her.

247
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,716
She completely disappeared
after what happened.

248
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,428
Why do you ask?

249
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,184
The missing gun
showed up at a crime scene.

250
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,356
Donghoon's gun?

251
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,160
VIOLENT CRIMES TEAM 3
SERGEANT CHO JINSAE

252
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,080
I've narrowed it down to two places.

253
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,633
Cho Jinsae met with Cha Giho.

254
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:14,401
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

255
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,241
Are you still looking
for your dad's killer?

256
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,993
Why'd you pretend not to know me?

257
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,372
Well…

258
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:33,670
Something very amusing
seems to be going on.

259
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:40,385
Want a tip?

260
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,054
Five years ago,

261
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,682
the one who buried your dad's case

262
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,517
was Cha Giho.

263
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,062
I heard a gun was found.

264
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,565
Is Cha Giho the suspect?

265
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:58,319
If you tell anyone who I am…

266
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,321
What would I gain from exposing you?

267
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,407
It'll just be a pain in the ass.

268
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,244
Good luck.

269
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,146
Serial number 20KG-0637.
Corporal Oh Hyejin.

270
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,733
Confirmed.

271
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,614
That's right.

272
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,073
We'll put out an APB.

273
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,493
Now?

274
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,496
Okay.

275
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,874
The police are conducting
a manhunt for Do Gangjae

276
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,044
and Kim Cheolho on suspicions
of murder and drug distribution.

277
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,881
They've distributed
ten billion won's worth of LSD

278
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,925
since November of last year.

279
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,052
Moreover, they are under suspicion

280
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,555
of murdering four members
of a competing organization.

281
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,266
The police are asking
for assistance from the people

282
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,019
to capture these dangerous criminals.

283
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,149
The government has issued
a new policy on real estate…

284
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,198
Call and locate him.

285
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,618
Gangjae doesn't know we have you.

286
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:34,833
If you call,

287
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,543
you're dead.

288
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,756
The three of you, out.

289
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,467
Didn't you hear him? Get up, assholes.

290
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,220
Get up, you three!

291
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,264
Now. Get out.

292
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:52,183
Asshole. Call and you're dead.

293
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,060
Hey, get out of here. Out!

294
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:56,688
-Get out.
-You made the right call.

295
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,152
Yoon Jiwoo.

296
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,156
What are you doing with her?

297
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,244
She wanted this.

298
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,833
You see,

299
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,503
I've caught many bad guys,

300
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,840
but you're a real demon.

301
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,512
A druggie like you wouldn't understand.

302
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,600
It's called conviction.

303
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,771
I don't know much
about shit like conviction.

304
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,608
But my silence will cost more now.

305
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,867
A few bags of drugs won't cut it.

306
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,703
I'm sure.

307
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,753
You never disappoint.

308
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:08,051
Let's see. How thick is
Mr. Choi's envelope for me?

309
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,387
You son of a bitch.

310
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,305
Damn it!

311
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,474
You prick. Hey!

312
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,810
I'm a detective, you son of a bitch.

313
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:18,978
Hey!

314
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,022
You son of a bitch.

315
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,796
I just got here.

316
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,966
Good job.

317
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,175
Why are you tipping him?

318
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,760
I'm in a good mood.

319
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,565
So? You let her through, you moron?

320
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,067
Shit.

321
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,443
Hang up.

322
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,156
Chair.

323
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:13,741
Now!

324
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:19,288
What now?

325
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,917
Why do you keep bugging me? Damn it.

326
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,086
You sold me out to Gangjae, didn't you?

327
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,675
I only did

328
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:32,593
as I was told.

329
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:38,349
This is a dilemma.

330
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,605
How should I get rid of the bastard
who tried to kill me?

331
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,491
I can be a cop and arrest you
for conspiracy to murder.

332
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:03,291
Or I can leak it to Choi Mujin
that you're the one who attacked his gym.

333
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,751
That wasn't me!

334
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,421
I only got the drugs.

335
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:09,630
I know.

336
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,844
But would Choi Mujin believe you?

337
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:18,556
Well…

338
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,308
That's probably better.

339
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,937
It'll be a pain to prove your crime.

340
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,523
Wait… Shit.

341
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,866
What do you want?

342
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:38,951
Tell me.

343
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,431
Do Gangjae is fleeing the country by boat.

344
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,055
Yes?

345
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:42,974
Captain Cha Giho?

346
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,396
This is Do Gangjae.

347
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,030
Why? Do you want to turn yourself in?

348
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:01,868
What? Like hell.

349
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,831
I'm trying to help you out, Captain.

350
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,464
Don't you want to catch Choi Mujin?

351
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,180
I'll let you catch him

352
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,683
if you let me get out.

353
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,574
Where did you get that intel?

354
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,993
From Jiwoo.

355
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,787
It may be a trap.

356
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,958
You think too much.

357
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,338
You suspect everything

358
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,174
and look for the safest route.

359
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,886
But now is the time to act.

360
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,140
I trust Jiwoo.

361
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,813
You stay here.

362
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,443
If anything happens,

363
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:20,780
someone must manage the organization.

364
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,928
TO JIWOO, FROM DAD

365
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,495
The cars are coming in.

366
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,336
It's Choi Mujin.

367
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,467
Team Two, moving to position.

368
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,940
JEON PILDO

369
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,197
DETECTIVE OH HYEJIN

370
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:39,085
Those damn narcs.

371
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:02,525
Don't move. Stay in position.

372
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,943
Don't move. Stay in position.

373
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,908
Gangjae.

374
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,453
Come out and say hi.

375
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,672
I'm glad you're here.

376
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,551
I thought I wouldn't see you before I go.

377
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,207
Captain. Do we move in?

378
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,211
Captain!

379
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:32,948
Captain!

380
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:35,993
Come here, Gangjae!

381
00:41:38,704 --> 00:41:40,706
Arrest them.

382
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,628
Freeze!

383
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,243
Haven't been stabbed in a while?

384
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,039
It's nice. Reminds me of the old days.

385
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,184
Get over here, Gangjae.

386
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,714
Fuck.

387
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,260
I wanted to live a fucking cool life.

388
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,721
You made a foolish choice.

389
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,519
So did you.

390
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,548
You let your guard down!

391
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,385
I won't die alone!

392
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,935
Don't move.

393
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,447
Run.

394
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,449
Now!

395
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,884
You stupid bitch.

396
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,845
You don't know anything.

397
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:07,014
Drop the knife.

398
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,974
Shoot.

399
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,351
You said you'd kill me.

400
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,937
So shoot.

401
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:16,815
Shoot.

402
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,277
Shoot!

403
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,864
You can't, can you?

404
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,908
Not anyone can fucking kill people.

405
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,659
Detective Oh, drop the gun!

406
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,663
What will he do

407
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,417
if he finds out you're Choi Mujin's peon?

408
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,849
Choi Mujin!

409
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,149
I caught you in the act.

410
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,126
Detective!

411
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,464
I'll turn myself in.
I'll confess everything.

412
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,133
Detective Oh, calm down.

413
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,555
And…

414
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,640
Yoon Ji--

415
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:01,211
This isn't it…

416
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,511
Fucking bitch.

417
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:24,544
