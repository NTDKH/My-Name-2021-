1
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,491
This is safe.

2
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:27,754
Go.

3
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,757
Will you be okay?

4
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,759
How does it feel to kill a person?

5
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,117
You will

6
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,578
never

7
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,705
ever

8
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,249
forget me.

9
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,750
Do I need to go in for questioning?

10
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,673
Want a drink?

11
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,645
It's the first snowfall.

12
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,025
It's cold.

13
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,778
Have you eaten?

14
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,410
Do you even eat?

15
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,887
The decor is so you.

16
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,477
Tonight isn't…

17
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:05,026
It's so stuffy in here.

18
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,240
You shouldn't be alone
on a day like today.

19
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,338
Do you like the snow?

20
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,720
You never answer me.

21
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:36,140
What do you like?

22
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,726
Don't you have any hobbies?

23
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:43,231
Your fridge tells me it's not cooking.

24
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,902
Not really.

25
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,281
Then what fun is life?

26
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,993
Is life fun?

27
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,248
Gosh.

28
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,668
You're so frustrating.

29
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:06,128
If you don't have any, make some.

30
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,838
People with jobs like ours

31
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,175
need time to relax and not think at all.

32
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,181
Sitting on the beach.

33
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,518
I like that.

34
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,603
I see.

35
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,190
Well…

36
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,278
How nice it would be
looking at the ocean on a day like this.

37
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:34,282
Should we go now?

38
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,118
You'll lose your license if we go now.

39
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,998
Let's go another time.

40
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,001
I'm a really good fisher.

41
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,461
You can't eat sushi at restaurants
after having mine.

42
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,713
You're in trouble.

43
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,844
There's no need to try so hard.

44
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,143
I'm all right.

45
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,324
You're not all right.

46
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:20,328
You and Gangjae…

47
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,581
knew each other, right?

48
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,377
I heard at the junkyard
before I passed out.

49
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,172
He called your name.

50
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,188
He tried to rape me a long time ago.

51
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,608
After drugging me.

52
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,451
I got this scar…

53
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,414
when I tried to wake myself from the drug…

54
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,799
So it was Gangjae.

55
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,929
The person you wanted to catch.

56
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:33,729
I thought we'd meet after we die,
but here you are again.

57
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,818
Are you still fighting your evils?

58
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,322
I have no choice

59
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,408
if I want to survive.

60
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,372
Living is a war.

61
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,712
You can't lose nor give in.
It is a war indeed.

62
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,344
I don't know how else to live.

63
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,807
Are there people you can trust?

64
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,397
That's good then.

65
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:18,732
Go after a few days' rest.

66
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,376
Attention.

67
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,008
These are the escape paths
Choi Mujin could have taken yesterday.

68
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:50,264
Find out if anyone within a 2km radius
is associated with Dongcheon.

69
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,016
He had to have gotten treated,

70
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,809
so find every hospital, vet,

71
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,061
and retired doctor in the area.
Understood?

72
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,229
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

73
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,360
Choi Mujin!

74
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,456
Hi. It's me, Detective Na.

75
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,168
Can I get all the documents
on that car with the fake plates?

76
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,295
Call me when they're ready.
I'll pick them up.

77
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,796
Okay.

78
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,404
JIWOO

79
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,657
SONG JOONSU

80
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:33,993
Song Joonsu…

81
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,744
Who is Song Joonsu?

82
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:38,330
He died less than a month
after joining Narcotics.

83
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,002
You don't know anything.

84
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,671
SENDER
DO GANGJAE

85
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:53,095
Jiwoo.

86
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,890
I'm going to stay here tonight. Come here.

87
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,312
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME…

88
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,337
What's that?

89
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,506
A factory that processes forest products.

90
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,973
What's over that ridge?

91
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,309
There is a small temple
on Cheonwang Mountain.

92
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,650
It's ready.

93
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:26,355
Have a seat.

94
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,445
How do you feel?

95
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,199
It hurts.

96
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,245
It's a long time since
I've been stabbed. It hurts.

97
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,915
I had forgotten…

98
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,794
how much it hurt.

99
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,551
Do Gangjae sent me a photo.

100
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:04,476
The Song Joonsu that died 17 years ago…

101
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:06,979
No…

102
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,899
Was Dad a cop?

103
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,578
Yes.

104
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,873
Donghoon was a cop.

105
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,459
Cha Giho had sent him

106
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,421
to take down our organization.

107
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,552
But Donghoon flipped to our side.

108
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,848
I told you before…

109
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,894
that he saved my life.

110
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,820
Let's go inside.

111
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:43,158
YOON DONGHOON

112
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,244
I didn't even know my dad's name.

113
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,081
Two names.

114
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,752
Two identities.

115
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,676
Must be why he always looked like
he was at the edge of a cliff.

116
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,308
That's how you look now.

117
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,689
Do you feel like you're on a cliff?

118
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,277
Whenever he had time,

119
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,029
he'd disappear somewhere by himself.

120
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,700
I assumed it was a girl.

121
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,705
One day,

122
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,624
I happened to come across him.

123
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,252
So I followed him.

124
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,298
I was worried
that he was seeing someone shady.

125
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,971
But I just turned around and left.

126
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,476
If she could make him smile like that,

127
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,563
it didn't matter who she was.

128
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,442
I found out later…

129
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,863
that you were in there.

130
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,703
Your dad is Yoon Donghoon.

131
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,749
He lived and died
as a member of the organization.

132
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:16,585
Jiwoo.

133
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,420
Don't lose focus.

134
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,299
Don't forget how you got here.

135
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,220
Why didn't you tell me?

136
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,476
Because you need conviction

137
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,270
in order to kill someone.

138
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:40,484
I wanted you to find the answer yourself.

139
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:06,343
Jiwoo.

140
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,972
Is there still more to confirm?

141
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,601
Or…

142
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,979
are you hesitating?

143
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,495
Have you

144
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,622
seen this man?

145
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,584
No one comes to our temple these days.

146
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,055
People don't come to the temple much
when the weather gets cold.

147
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:58,937
Hello?

148
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,818
Where are you?

149
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,091
Was Dongcheon involved?

150
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,593
Dongcheon killed him.

151
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,888
Cha Giho could not accept
Donghoon's betrayal

152
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,433
and killed him.

153
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,269
Those assholes can die.

154
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,048
Like what happened to Yoon Donghoon.

155
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,096
Welcome.

156
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,393
Captain.

157
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,687
Hey, you're here.

158
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,607
Want some soju?

159
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:28,526
It's all burnt.

160
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:31,488
I won't…

161
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,407
be able to…

162
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,955
fall asleep if I'm sober tonight.

163
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,176
Pildo.

164
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,389
What will you do if you find
the asshole who killed your sister?

165
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,435
I'll catch him.

166
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,354
What if there's no evidence?

167
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,525
What if you find him…

168
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,445
but there's no evidence?

169
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,587
What if

170
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,923
you have the chance to kill him?

171
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:35,719
No witnesses, no cameras. Nothing!

172
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:40,056
What would you do?

173
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,896
Do you remember what you said
when I joined Narcotics?

174
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,069
"Drug investigation is
building a sandcastle.

175
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,197
You work hard to build it,

176
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,783
but the wave comes
and knocks it down repeatedly.

177
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:04,873
But if you keep at it,
the low tide will come eventually.

178
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,752
That's when you catch the culprit."

179
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,468
Choi Mujin.

180
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,471
We can catch him.

181
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,061
Not bad.

182
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,277
I learned from the best.

183
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,287
-May I get a glass, please?
-Okay.

184
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:49,876
Yes, sir?

185
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:50,794
Taeju.

186
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,880
I don't think Jiwoo can finish the job.

187
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,259
You get rid of Cha Giho.

188
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,892
Yes, sir.

189
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,982
YOON DONGHOON

190
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,657
Just a minute.

191
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,035
Wait. Careful.

192
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,370
Let's go.

193
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,982
SECURITY GUARD BREAK TIMES

194
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,486
We're home.

195
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,695
-Want to get off?
-Yes.

196
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,530
Careful.

197
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,865
Careful.

198
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,241
Your head.

199
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,702
Get up. You're home.

200
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,496
One, two, three.

201
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,123
Where's your key?

202
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,541
I have it.

203
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,961
-I have it, so go.
-Okay.

204
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,257
Go, Pildo.

205
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,009
-Just open it.
-I'm okay.

206
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,135
Go ahead.

207
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,096
-Want me to stay the night?
-Hey.

208
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,273
-I'll be going.
-Yes. Go, Pildo.

209
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,026
-I love you.
-Okay.

210
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,881
Oh Hyejin.

211
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,258
Choi Mujin's dog!

212
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,887
Are you here to finish me off?

213
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,350
Drop the knife.

214
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,980
Don't you see what's in my hand?

215
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,567
Drop the knife.

216
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,196
I came to ask you a question.

217
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,324
A question?

218
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,787
I may finish you off
depending on your answer.

219
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,295
My dad died because of me.

220
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,551
But he never dropped his knife
until the moment he died. To protect me.

221
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:36,639
I threw everything away
and came this far to catch the bastard.

222
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,859
Tell me what you did to my dad
five years ago today.

223
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,070
Tell me!

224
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,540
Jiwoo?

225
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,128
Yoon Jiwoo?

226
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,388
You remember my name.

227
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:20,975
Why?

228
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,020
Do you feel guilty?

229
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,356
Donghoon… No.

230
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:32,361
Joonsu was not
a member of the organization.

231
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:36,199
He was a cop.

232
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,408
I know that.

233
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,371
And also that you sent him
into that organization.

234
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,625
But Dad betrayed you.
Is that why you killed him?

235
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,211
Song Jiwoo…

236
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,048
How did you…

237
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,636
end up under Choi Mujin?

238
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,101
Choi Mujin…

239
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,895
That demon!

240
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,203
Captain!

241
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,623
Captain.

242
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,250
Captain!

243
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,627
-Captain!
-Jiwoo.

244
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:31,712
Captain!

245
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,673
Jiwoo.

246
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:41,848
Captain.

247
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,314
Captain!

248
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,485
Captain!

249
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,766
Get out of here.

250
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,874
JUNG TAEJU
SECOND-IN-COMMAND

251
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,337
Taeju, you arrange them.

252
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,254
Okay.

253
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:57,798
You, step in.

254
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,425
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,802
-You won last year too, right?
-That's correct.

256
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,845
That's two years in a row.

257
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,681
-Don't compete starting next year.
-Yes, sir.

258
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,641
Dongcheon!

259
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,392
-Dongcheon!
-Dongcheon!

260
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:50,226
Take it easy, man. Easy.

261
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,064
Enough.

262
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,440
That's enough.

263
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:02,863
What is this?

264
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:05,658
Birthday present.

265
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:09,912
Dumbass.

266
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:10,997
Isn't it awesome?

267
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:15,793
Test it out.

268
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,589
So I can die quickly?

269
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,882
You punk.

270
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,594
Don't use disposable lighters.
You're the boss. Look the part.

271
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,929
This doesn't make a sound.

272
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:29,473
Yes, it does.

273
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,104
What sound did you expect?

274
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:51,055
CHOI MUJIN, YOON DONGHOON, AND 5 OTHERS

00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,929
Joonsu…

280
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,391
was a cop to his last breath.

281
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,853
You'll see here.

282
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,441
NOVEMBER 30, 2016

283
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,943
Happy birthday, my dear daughter.

284
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,779
Taeju. Get out.

285
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,030
PUREUNSOL MEMORIAL PARK

RECIPIENT: CHA GIHO

289
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,036
Jiwoo.

290
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,081
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME
PLEASE GIVE TO JIWOO

291
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,750
Thank you…

292
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,171
for staying alive.

293
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,133
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME
PLEASE GIVE TO JIWOO

294
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,226
TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER JIWOO

295
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,424
Jiwoo.

296
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,262
My daughter who grew up too quickly.

297
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:40,349
There were so many things
I wanted to do with you.

298
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:47,439
Whenever there's hardship,
I want to tell you to trust me.

299
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,776
If you fall in love,

300
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,696
I want to worry what kind of guy he is.

301
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,074
I want to watch you get married

302
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,368
and have children.

303
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,163
I want to share all those days with you,

304
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,333
but…

305
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,794
it may be that

306
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:11,171
those days never come.

307
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,636
I was an inadequate dad,

308
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,598
but I was happy because of you.

309
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,767
You have to be happy

310
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:28,022
and live a good life
even if I'm not around.

311
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,650
I'm sorry I can't be by your side.

312
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:35,946
I love you.

313
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,327
Your father…

314
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,414
was my most trusted friend and brother.

315
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,085
Must you get revenge?

316
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,464
Regardless of the price?

317
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,799
This is the gun that killed your dad.

318
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,552
Find him

319
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,137
and kill him.

320
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,361
Donghoon's killer is a cop.

321
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,529
This is my knife.

322
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,490
Kill him as soon as you find him.

323
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,492
Don't fall for it.

324
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:26,497
Chamomile tea. It's good for insomnia.

325
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:37,424
YOON DONGHOON

326
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,512
Because you need conviction

327
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,264
in order to kill someone.

328
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:43,550
Hang in there.

329
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:34,828
