1
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:29,529
SONG JOONSU

2
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:31,448
Donghoon… No.

3
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,992
Joonsu was not a member
of the organization.

4
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,702
SONG JOONSU,
INCHANG DRUG INVESTIGATION UNIT

5
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,995
He was a cop.

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,339
Pildo.

7
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,845
How's Captain?

8
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,930
He's still in surgery.

9
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,974
It's been over four hours.

10
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,279
I brought him home last night.

11
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,366
He seemed nervous,
so I offered to stay with him, but…

12
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,915
I'm sure Choi Mujin was behind it,
but I don't know why.

13
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,210
Why Captain?

14
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,297
We'll catch the assailant soon.

15
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,299
Captain shot him.

16
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,594
We found blood and fingerprints
at the scene.

17
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,518
Why do you look so pale?

18
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:46,523
I didn't sleep well.

19
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,444
Hey.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,446
It didn't record?

21
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,658
Get all the surveillance videos nearby.

22
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,660
Okay. I'll go too.

23
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,961
The surgery went well.

24
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,589
We'll move him to the ICU and monitor him.

25
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,471
Cha Giho survived.

26
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,223
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,313
Jiwoo was there at the scene.

28
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,316
She may have found out the truth.

29
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,652
We must kill her.

30
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:52,190
Captain.

31
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,757
What will you do if you find
the asshole who killed your sister?

32
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,301
What if you find him…

33
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,222
but there's no evidence?

34
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,809
We'll get Choi Mujin first

35
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,144
while Do Gangjae has him rattled.

36
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,656
You should stay put for the time being.

37
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,493
The police are after you
for Gangjae's murder.

38
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,930
She wants to get revenge.

39
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,560
Let her.

40
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,952
JEON PILDO

41
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:03,798
Come here, kid!

42
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,413
I told you

43
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:19,916
it was foolish.

44
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,004
You're a traitor's daughter,

45
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,964
but you said you'd kill the culprit.

46
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:29,926
I served Donghoon

47
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,761
very closely.

48
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,472
He didn't belong in a crime ring.

49
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,897
How does it feel to have lived cluelessly
as our pawn?

50
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,867
You killed my dad, didn't you?

51
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,329
I wanted to kill him myself.

52
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,501
You've never seen the real Choi Mujin.

53
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,675
He always kills traitors personally.

54
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,763
To watch them take their final breath.

55
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,685
I wonder how your dad looked then.

56
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,106
How will you look when you die?

57
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,651
Let's find out.

58
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,675
Do you assholes think you're human?

59
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:17,843
What about…

60
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,221
you?

61
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,515
Are you still human?

62
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,569
Did you get the videos?

63
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,030
Yes. From all the streets nearby.

64
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:38,948
Let's see.

65
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,576
Narcotics, Detective Na Daesoo speaking.

66
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:43,953
Yes.

67
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,414
Yes, what I asked for before.

68
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:49,917
Yes.

69
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,087
Where is that?

70
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,383
Okay.

71
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,010
So, 7-35?

72
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:01,554
Okay. Thank you.

73
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,681
Please head out first.

74
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,890
We'll be close behind.

75
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:06,434
Thank you.

76
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:08,811
-Let's go.
-Where?

77
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,814
A retired doctor
who lives near the tunnel said

78
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,191
he treated a man in his 50s
with a stab wound 3 days ago.

79
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,861
-Where?
-Cheonwang Temple.

80
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,837
Choi Mujin.

81
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,050
Hey.

82
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,068
COME IN ASAP
WE GOT CHOI MUJIN

83
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,721
You did this, right?

84
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,280
Captain Cha Giho, too.

85
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,953
Why did you do it?

86
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,665
Why did you turn yourself in?

87
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,338
Were you scared after stabbing a cop?

88
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,883
Did you feel like it was over?

89
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,554
There are various people in the world.

90
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,393
Everyone thinks they're special.

91
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,442
But if you look carefully,

92
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,696
it's one or the other.

93
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:28,784
Predator…

94
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,121
or prey.

95
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,667
Either you eat or get eaten.

96
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,630
Cha Giho was prey
pretending to be a predator.

97
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,967
So he won't live long.

98
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:49,847
And you?

99
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,143
Which do you think you are?

100
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,063
You killed people,

101
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,773
sold drugs,

102
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,069
and did all sorts of nasty things.

103
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,948
And that's your excuse?

104
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,662
You had to live this way
because you're a predator?

105
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,250
The premise itself is wrong.

106
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,797
Think it over slowly
while you're in a cell.

107
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,051
You'll have plenty of time.

108
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,556
Jeon.

109
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,266
Pil.

110
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,061
Do.

111
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,730
Do you think…

112
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,818
you can do that to me?

113
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,163
Pildo.

114
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,540
What is that asshole up to?

115
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,419
He's either cornered
or has something up his sleeve.

116
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,881
That asshole's done for
once Captain wakes up.

117
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,969
Hey.

118
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,053
Excuse me.

119
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,431
He won't get off this time.

120
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,951
INCHANG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

121
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,289
Hey. Why are you so hard to reach?

122
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,546
How did you catch him?

123
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,464
He turned himself in.

124
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,344
Pildo is pressuring him
about the Do Gangjae case.

125
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,014
I'll go in too.

126
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,284
Why did you turn yourself in?

127
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,205
I…

128
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,999
Sir.

129
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:27,588
came to prove I am innocent.

130
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,070
I never stabbed Do Gangjae.

131
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,201
I never ordered Cha Giho's death either.

132
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,458
Are you relying on him?

133
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,545
The mole you planted among us.

134
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,966
The one who told you
about the cameras at the hotel

135
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,345
and leaked investigation details to you.
Your loyal servant.

136
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,351
Whoever it is, he can't get you out.

137
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,192
I clearly saw you stab Do Gangjae.

138
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,863
And we have the knife
with your fingerprints…

139
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,201
all over it.

140
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,039
We don't need your confession.

HEAD OF LEGAL AFFAIRS
KANG SOOYEON

142
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,003
We'll have a warrant in an hour.

143
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:58,929
You're finished.

144
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:20,909
Detective Oh.

145
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,036
Going somewhere?

146
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,001
To my car.

147
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,794
I left something there.

148
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,173
You knew he had a mole?

149
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,802
I was testing him

150
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,972
to see if he had someone.

151
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,644
Is there a mole?

152
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:50,105
It's just speculation.

153
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,482
I couldn't identify him yet.

154
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,361
Be quick. We have work to do.

155
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:00,908
Pildo.

156
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,457
Thank you for everything.

157
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,503
Answer my calls.

158
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,798
Whatever the situation,
you answer my call.

159
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,067
-Sir.
-Hey.

160
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,276
We found it.

161
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,361
What?

162
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,416
This is a car that arrived and left
around the time Captain was attacked.

163
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,376
This SUV?

164
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,465
-I'll look up the plates.
-Okay.

165
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,425
Follow him. See where he went.

166
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,604
What is it?

167
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:13,939
Hello.

168
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:18,527
Captain Cha had requested this.

169
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,779
What is it?

170
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:25,117
He said to give it to you
if anything happened to him.

CORPORAL OH HYEJIN OF NARCOTICS

173
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,710
Thank you.

174
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,627
Sure.

175
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:50,976
EVIDENCE STORAGE

176
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,191
I came to check some evidence.

177
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,068
Okay.

178
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,256
You're looking for evidence
from Do Gangjae's murder case, correct?

179
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,260
Yes, that's correct.

180
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,305
Damn. I can't trace this car.

181
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:30,098
It's 60K 8640, right?

182
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,099
Yes, that's right.

183
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,145
I think it's a fake plate.

184
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:36,688
What?

185
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,364

Sir.

OH HYEJIN, CORPORAL

00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,922
Please return it by 6 p.m.

No one comes to our temple these days.

192
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,330
Where's Detective Oh?

193
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,332
Come look at this.

194
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,556
I removed the evidence.

195
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,227
Okay.

196
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,839
Stop Detective Oh Hyejin
from leaving the building.

197
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,300
This is the control room.

198
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:33,471
Report to the control room immediately
if you spot Corporal Oh Hyejin.

199
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,473
Corporal Oh Hyejin
of the Drug Investigation Unit…

200
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,809
The evidence won't be a problem.

201
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:41,688
Yes.

202
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,318
I'll tell you the details later
when we meet in person.

203
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,918
She stopped by the evidence hold.
She took evidence from the Gangjae case.

204
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,474
She was seen by the back door. Back door!

205
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,409
Close the gate!

206
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,163
Stop!

207
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,465
We're not done questioning you!

208
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,549
Choi Mujin!

209
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,139
Is there any reason
for my client to be here any longer?

210
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,767
Call me if you find any evidence.

211
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,935
I will assert

212
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,437
that that evidence was tainted.

213
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,827
Did you find Hyejin?

214
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:21,037
No, we lost her.

215
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,055
Damn! Are you saying
she joined our team on purpose

216
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,183
to siphon information
and even stabbed Captain?

217
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,145
Geonpyeong. Get Detective Oh's…

218
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,023
No.

219
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,692
Take this bitch's things
and run her prints.

220
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,736
-What?
-Oh Hyejin

221
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,279
isn't Oh Hyejin.

222
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,240
I'm sure that's not her real name.

223
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,205
Hey, Pildo! Snap out of it!

224
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,416
We have to catch her, jerk!

225
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,667
-Stop it. That's enough.
-Gosh.

226
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:11,212
We have to catch her and ask her
why she stabbed Captain!

227
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,716
Let go! Damn it.

228
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,146
Because dangerous assholes have
a new drug but no one is investigating.

229
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,856
Is that really all?

230
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,191
Does it…

231
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:35,737
not matter how many gang members die?

232
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,448
Was Choi Mujin killed?

233
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,577
Was everything…

234
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,164
Was all of it a lie?

235
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,545
CHOI MUJIN

236
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,842
Because you're one of them?

237
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,231
Was Detective Oh one of ours?

238
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,318
The passport for your friend's daughter.

239
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,029
Yes.

240
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,282
Did you turn yourself in

241
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,410
to test her?

242
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,122
I had to be sure.

243
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,669
It would be a waste to kill her.

244
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:36,714
I'm surprised.

245
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,552
Her identity will be exposed
and she'll be a fugitive,

246
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,262
but she was willing to go this far.

247
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,849
How did you win her over to your side?

248
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:58,570
I deceived her.

249
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,672
I choose to trust Detective Oh.

250
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,466
Jeon Pildo!

251
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,639
She got me out to kill me.

252
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:54,978
This is my knife.

253
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,900
Kill him as soon as you find him.

254
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:23,673
Taeju, come here.

255
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,383
-Come here.
-Take one with us.

256
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,273
We'll go and get that bitch.

257
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:45,945
Do you know where she is?

258
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,825
Wait.

259
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,537
She'll come on her own.

260
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,341
Her life's goal…

261
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:09,719
is me.

262
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,602
My dad and I promised we'd build a house
on a beach and live there.

263
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,648
If he hadn't killed Dad…

264
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,528
would I have been able to live like that?

265

Hey.

270
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,546
Pildo. I just heard back.

271
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,216
Her prints aren't in the system.

272
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,134
That bitch…

273
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,221
She didn't even register her fingerprints.

274
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:21,225
That means
Dongcheon bred her meticulously.

275
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,144
It's a mess in here.

276
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,563
Pildo. You need to get over here.

277
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,649
DO NOT ENTER

DECEASED, KIM JEONGA

279
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,491
Sorry, Dad.

280
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:23,329
I didn't know how you had been living.

281
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,961
If I had, rather than hating
and resenting you,

282
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,840
I would've hugged you more.

283
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,928
It must've been so lonely and exhausting.

284
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,058
I think I can understand you now.

285
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,896
I miss you,

286
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:50,940
Dad.

287
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,578
Damn.

288
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,205
Hey.

289
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,125
What do you make of this?

290
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,751
Something definitely happened.

291
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,379
Her things are all gone.

292
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,882
And there's no one here.

293
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,094
Maybe Choi Mujin
already cleared the place out.

294
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,221
Damn it.

295
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,770

I'll be back, Dad.

298
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,116
Watch.

299
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,786
See how I end this.

300
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,062
Freeze!

301
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,316
Turn around.

302
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:02,947
Don't test me anymore.

303
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,201
You've toyed with me enough.

304
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:19,588
Put your hands up.

305
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,231
You are under arrest for obstruction
of justice and attempted murder.

306
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,445
You have the right to an attorney.

307
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,572
You may testify on your behalf.

308
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:48,701
You may challenge

-Sir.

311
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,531
Let go.

312
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,159
To think I considered her a colleague.
Hey. Look up.

313
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,827
Hey.

314
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,662
Your life is over,

315
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,373
you traitor asshole.

316
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:37,083
Bitch.

317
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,293
Let go.

318
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,753
Let go of me!

319
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,807
Can we get her out?

320
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:56,769
She stole evidence from the police
and was caught on camera doing it.

321
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,729
There's no way.

322
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,772
We must get her out.

323
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,816
In case she confesses?

324
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,235
She won't confess.

325
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,780
She's probably waiting for me
to do something.

326
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,617
You said she killed Mr. Jung
and will come to kill you.

327
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,745
Are you saying you'll make her come?

328
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,722
Give us some privacy.

329
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:34,723
Yes, sir.

330
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,821
Captain was suspicious of you.

331
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:51,699
Is that why you stabbed him?

332
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,410
In case he'd expose your identity?

333
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,542
Why did you thank me?

334
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,546
For being fooled?

335
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:08,841
Tell me.

336
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,970
Make an excuse. Lie. Say something!

337
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,145
I trusted you.

338
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,109
