1
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,119
What's your name?

2
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:45,545
What's your real name?

3
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:05,815
Relay my message.

4
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,060
I don't need a lawyer.

5
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,232
I'm not here to represent you.

6
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,363
Mr. Choi asked me to relay a message.

7
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,369
I will not let you go to prison.

8
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,707
Come to me.

9
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,386
You were hurt badly.

10
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,228
My client needs medical attention.

11
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,187
Medical attention?

12
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,899
Our captain is still unconscious.

13
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,318
Should I submit a formal complaint?

14
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,696
Worry about yourself first
before your client.

15
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,365
You should cut your losses.

16
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,203
Bring me documents on Dongcheon,
and we'll request mitigation.

17
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:45,290
The reporters seem to be curious
about what happened.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,670
If we say there was a mole
Dongcheon planted within Narcotics,

19
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,922
that would be breaking news.

20
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,178
She left for the hospital.

21
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,893
Bring her.

22
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,270
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

23
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:53,459
WARD 15

24
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,090
Captain?

25
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,050
Pildo.

26
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,014
I'm at the hospital. I'll come right over.

27
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,808
-Is he awake?
-Yes.

28
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,976
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

29
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:10,935
Okay.

30
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:20,445
Please, bear it.

31
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,779
Miss.

32
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,872
Help me.

33
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,770
Please cut.

34
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,438
Okay.

35
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,529
Get me the dressing band.

36
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,698
The band.

37
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,575
Sorry. I'll go get it.

38
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,015
Hello? Yes, professor.

39
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,267
I checked on him this morning.

40
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,895
He looked really bad.

41
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,105
He was very septic,

42
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:42,193
had a high fever, and his CRP level was
between five and ten.

43
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,861
So we got a CT scan.

44
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,864
I took a look at it,
and it looked very bad.

45
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,368
As you said it could be endocytosis,
I thought it may be better

46
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,661
to just operate instead.

47
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,664
So I scheduled it
for the afternoon surgery.

48
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,666
Captain.

49
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:58,793
Are you all right?

50
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:01,629
Hey.

51
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,965
I almost died.

52
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,844
-Do you want some water?
-I'm all right.

53
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,057
Detective Oh--

54
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,267
We caught her.

55
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,478
She's the one who stabbed you, right?
She's in the hospital--

56
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,479
Pildo.

57
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,524
Yes?

58
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,115
You know…

59
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,452
Yoon Donghoon, don't you?

60
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,121
Yoon Donghoon of Dongcheon

61
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,915
who was murdered five years ago?

62
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:38,833
Yes.

63
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,418
Detective Oh is…

64
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,464
Yoon Donghoon's daughter.

65
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:02,190
Yoon Donghoon's real name was Song Joonsu.

66
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,526
Wait.

67
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,572
Do you mean
the Narcotics detective that died…

68
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,619
He was undercover.

69
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,457
I sent him into Dongcheon.

70
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,132
I think it would be best
and scheduled it for this afternoon.

71
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:31,093
So he'll be going into surgery
this afternoon.

72
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,345
Yes.

73
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,806
You don't need to worry.

74
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,475
Well, just in case…

75
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,685
I'm almost done here.

76
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,897
Once I finish, I'll check on him again.

77
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,900
Yes.

78
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,615
Jung Taeju is the one who stabbed me.

79
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:55,785
I brought him home last night.

80
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,746
He seemed nervous,
so I offered to stay with him, but…

81
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:02,291
It wasn't your fault.

82
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,796
So it was Gangjae.

83
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,465
The person you wanted to catch.

84
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,178
You're doing this
because of your father, right?

85
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,682
Jiwoo

86
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,852
joined her dad's killer to get revenge.

87
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,066
Choi Mujin deceived her.

88
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,822
If I tell you,

89
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,367
would you believe me?

90
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,120
Pildo.

91
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,040
Thank you for everything.

92
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,426
Please finish up.

93
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,343
Okay.

94
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,516
-Are you done?
-She'll be out soon.

95
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,517
Thank you.

96
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,235
Take the side door and go down to B2.

97
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,321
My car's there.

98
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,632
I'm fine with this.

99
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,967
I wanted to beat you anyway.

100
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,158
-Hello?
-Pildo.

101
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,369
Hyejin got away.

102
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,156
Song Jiwoo!

103
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,331
Let go!

104
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,792
Song Jiwoo.

105
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,253
That's your name, isn't it?

106
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,800
What do you plan to do?

107
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,179
Are you going to Choi Mujin?

108
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,725
Captain told me.

109
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,351
Did you let him go

110
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,812
so that you can kill him yourself?

111
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,024
That's right, so step aside.

112
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,236
No.

113
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,946
I'll stop you.

114
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,621
Let go!

115
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,788
Enough already!

116
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,998
Let go!

117
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,752
You know everything now.

118
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:16,629
You must know why I'm doing this!

119
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,924
I do.

120
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,801
That's why I'm stopping you.

121
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,929
No, you don't know

122
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,223
how I got here.

123
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:33,103
I threw away my future and my name
to catch the asshole who killed my dad.

124
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,107
But I was fooled by him
and even killed a person.

125
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,736
If I don't kill him,
my life has no meaning.

126
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,371
Is that all your life is worth?

127
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,124
Stay out of it and leave.

128
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,718
How can I ignore you
when you're driving toward sure death?

129
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,639
Even if you kill him,
you'll be utterly destroyed.

130
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,266
Don't you get it?

131
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,934
I don't care. Uncuff me.

132
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:13,936
I do.

133
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:18,148
Uncuff me!

134
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:21,569
Uncuff me!

135
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:43,966
Get in here.

136
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:54,101
Get them! Go after them! Stop!

137
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,163
Hold on tight.

138
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,907
We lost her.

139
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,952
Another detective took her
and they disappeared.

140
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,018
We came sooner than expected.

141
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:26,980
I told you we'd come

142
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,690
to the beach.

143
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,863
A friend who loves to surf
rented this place long-term.

144
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,773
Let me see your wounds.

145
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,109
I'm fine.

146
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,116
Don't get me angry.

147
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,456
Sit down.

148
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,157
I started carrying a knife
after my sister died.

149
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,996
I was determined to kill the bastard

150
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,749
if I ever found him.

151
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,473
Every night, I dreamt

152
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,518
of killing that faceless bastard.

153
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,147
And eventually,

154
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,108
my face changed.

155
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,492
Like a murderer consumed with rage.

156
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:32,833
I…

157
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,339
was stabbing myself.

158
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,848
Stop destroying yourself.

159
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,479
Stay still.

160
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,852
Don't struggle alone anymore.

161
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,356
You can lean on me anytime.

162
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:59,057
Choi Mujin put a tattoo on my chest.

163
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,688
And I burned it off.

164
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,369
You and I chose different paths.

165
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,046
Let's catch Choi Mujin

166
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,757
together.

167
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,056
It's what your father wanted.

168
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,059
Judging him by the law
rather than killing him.

169
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,110
Your father wanted it so much
that he was willing to sacrifice his life.

170
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,239
And you'll be the one to do it.

171
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:31,941
BOW RESTAURANT

172
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,610
-Sir.
-Taeju!

173
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,987
-Where are the boys?
-Not here yet.

174
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:37,781
Hello.

175
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,700
Pork belly

176
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,413
Sorry, Minjae!

177
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,956
Hey, scram.

178
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,543
Hey. Go home and study.

179
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,546
-What?
-I want to join Dongcheon.

180
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,006
-Hey.
-Take your bag and go.

181
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,883
-What grade are you in?
-Pick this up and go.

182
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,635
-Let him talk.
-What?

183
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,845
What do you mean? He's a kid.

184
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,222
Why do you want to join?

185
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:04,724
Well…

186
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,060
I want to be cool like you guys.

187
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,396
Gosh.

188
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,480
Are you smart?

189
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,607
Yes, I am.

190
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,984
Hey. Go home and study.

191
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,027
I mean it, Boss.

192
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,781
-You kids watch way too many movies.
-Please accept me. I know I can do it.

193
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,865
Get over here.

194
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,229
Boss. Donghoon…

195
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,423
Dad.

196
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,425
Dad!

197
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,391
Dad.

198
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,977
Dad!

199
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,314
Jiwoo, don't come out!

200
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,191
Don't come out yet.

201
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,568
Open the door!

202
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:41,905
I…

203
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,532
have never…

204
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,746
betrayed someone who trusted me.

205
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,918
Why do I keep getting betrayed?

206
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:02,759
At least…

207
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,638
She has a reason to kill me.

208
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,184
That's why…

209
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,354
That's why…

210
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,398
she should've come to me.

211
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,951
Isn't that right, Donghoon?

212
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,037
She should've come to me.

213
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,793
She should've come to me.

214
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,630
The police have requested
an arrest warrant.

215
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:42,674
You must flee.

216
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:46,135
They say they have a strong witness.
It's probably Detective Oh.

217
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,887
You should flee.

218
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,812
You said she would come to kill you.

219
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,814
Exactly.

220
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,692
She should've come to me.

221
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,237
She should've

222
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,573
come to me!

223
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,036
Going back to the police is betrayal.

224
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,251
Sir.

225
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,137
Ever since I saved her
from dying on the street,

226
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,388
her life belonged to me.

227
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:32,849
You need to stop--

228
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,392
No!

229
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,979
I can't stop.

230
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,983
It's not something I can just stop midway.

231
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,823
It won't end until one of us dies.

232
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,202
Either die…

233
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,957
or kill.

234
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,378
So, leave.

235
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,632
Leave!

236
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,332
Jiwoo.

237
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,794
Even if I'm not around,

238
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,923
be happy and live a good life, okay?

239
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,743
You thought I left, didn't you?

240
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:41,412
I got scared.

241
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,373
"Don't be scared.

242
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,292
We're cops."

243
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,427
Let's go now.

244
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,508
Where should we go?

245
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,844
Far away from here.

246
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,388
Dongcheon is finished.

247
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,014
Yes, ma'am.

248
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,089
It'll be very hard.

249
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,759
The entire world will condemn you.

250
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,846
And you'll be incarcerated.

251
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,602
I know.

252
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,940
I'm prepared.

253
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,908
Whatever you go through,

254
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,077
I'll be by your side.

255
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,287
Hey!

256
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,080
Pildo!

257
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,166
Jeon Pildo!

258
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,338
What happened?

259
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:03,799
Choi Mujin.

260
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,134
We can catch him.

261
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,587
Open the door.

262
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,313
Hey!

263
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,582
-Where is that bitch?
-Hurry and find her.

264
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,102
You look tired.

265
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,605
It's bearable.

266
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:13,442
I still have enough energy to kill you.

267
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,619
Sure. Of course.

268
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,210
Donghoon was weak.

269
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,756
He had several chances to kill me,

270
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,050
but he lacked the courage.

271
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,180
He was born to be prey.

272
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,316
Himself,

273
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,402
his daughter,

274
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,529
me…

275
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,535
So weak he made
everyone around him miserable.

276
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,626
But you were different.

277
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,130
You acted without fear.

278
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,135
So why?

279
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,390
Haven't you been waiting for this moment?

280
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,767
So why?

281
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,062
Why did you hesitate?

282
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:55,461
That's right, I hesitated.

283
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:01,425
Because I wanted to live
like a human being.

284
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,019
You asked if I wanted revenge
regardless of the price.

285
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,564
I didn't know what you meant back then.

286
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,068
But I do now.

287
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,325
The price of revenge is
becoming a monster.

288
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,952
A monster like you.

289
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:43,175
That's right.

290
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,597
You're a lot like me.

291
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,100
Can you become…

292
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:56,396
a monster?

293
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,610
Because I hesitated,

294
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:07,074
another person precious to me died.

295
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,163
Someone who understood my pain.

296
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:17,751
The one person I could lean on.

297
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:27,928
I'll become…

298
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,349
a monster.

299
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:40,440
And I'll watch you closely
as you take your last breath.

300
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,769
Can you kill me like that?

301
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,650
Good.

302
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,095
Get up.

303
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,597
That's right.

304
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,483
Get up!

305
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,154
Stab me!

306
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,285
Again.

307
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,038
That's right.

308
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,082
That's right.

309
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,711
You have to get up.

310
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:13,176
It won't end until one of us dies.

311
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,351
The temple.

312
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:06,688
Upper lip.

313
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,025
Chin.

314
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,402
Solar plexus.

315
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,655
Stab me.

316
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,368
Stab me.

317
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,247
Stab me!

318
00:51:27,292 --> 00:51:28,210
Stab me!

319
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,597
This is where it ends for you.

320
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,144
Accept it.

321
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:48,814
You

322
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:51,149
cannot become a monster.

323
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:33,895
